prefacemany histories of philosophy exist and it has not been my purpose merely to add one to theirnumber my purpose is to exhibit philosophy as an integral part of social and political life not asthe isolated speculations of remarkable individuals but as both an effect and a cause of thecharacter of the various communities in which different systems flourished this purposedemands more account of general history than is usually given by historians of philosophy i havefound this particularly necessary as regards periods with which the general reader cannot beassumed to be familiar the great age of the scholastic philosophy was an outcome of the reformsof the eleventh century and these in turn were a reaction against previous corruption withoutsome knowledge of the centuries between the fall of rome and the rise of the medieval papacythe intellectual atmosphere of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries can hardly be understood indealing with this period as with others i have aimed at giving only so much general history as ithought necessary for the sympathetic comprehension of philosophers in relation to the times thatformed them and the times that they helped to form one consequence of this point of view is that the importance which it gives to a philosopher isoften not that which he deserves on account of his philosophic merit for my part for example iconsider spinoza a greater philosopher than locke but he was far less influential i havetherefore treated him much more briefly than locke some menfor example rousseau and byronthough not philosophers at all in the academic sense have so profoundly affected theprevailing philosophic temper that the development of philosophy cannot be understood if theyare ignored even pure men of action are sometimes of great importance in this respect very fewphilosophers have influenced philosophy as much as alexander the great charlemagne or napoleon lycurgus if only be had existed would have been a still more notable example in attempting to cover such a vast stretch of time it is necessary to have very drastic principles ofselection i have come to the conclusion from reading standard histories of philosophy that veryshort accounts convey nothing of value to the reader i have therefore omitted altogether men who did not seem to me to deserve a fairly full treatment in the case of themen whom i have discussed i have mentioned what seemed relevant as regards their lives andtheir social surroundings i have even sometimes recorded intrinsically unimportant details when i considered them illustrative of a man or of his times finally i owe a word of explanation and apology to specialists on any part of my enormoussubject it is obviously impossible to know as much about every philosopher as can be knownabout him by a man whose field is less wide i have no doubt that every single philosopher whom i have mentioned with the exception of leibniz is better known to many men than to me ifhowever this were considered a sufficient reason for respectful silence it would follow that noman should undertake to treat of more than some narrow strip of history the influence of spartaon rousseau of plato on christian philosophy until the thirteenth century of the nestorians onthe arabs and thence on aquinas of saint ambrose on liberal political philosophy from the riseof the lombard cities until the present day are some among the themes of which only acomprehensive history can treat on such grounds i ask the indulgence of those readers who findmy knowledge of this or that portion of my subject less adequate than it would have been if there bad been no needto remember times winged chariot this book owes its existence to dr albert c barnes having been originally designed and partlydelivered as lectures at the barnes foundation in pennsylvania as in most of my work during the last thirteen years i have been greatly assisted in research andin many other ways by my wife patricia russell bertrand russell introductionthe conceptions of life and the world which we call philosophical are a product of two factorsone inherited religious and ethical conceptions the other the sort of investigation which may becalled scientific using this word in its broadest sense individual philosophers have differedwidely in regard to the proportions in which these two factors entered into their systems but it isthe presence of both in some degree that characterizes philosophy philosophy is a word which has been used in many ways some wider some narrower i proposeto use it in a very wide sense which i will now try to explain philosophy as i shall understand the word is something intermediate between theology andscience like theology it consists of speculations on matters as to which definite knowledge hasso far been unascertainable but like science it appeals to human reason rather than to authoritywhether that of tradition or that of revelation all definite knowledgeso i should contendbelongs to science all dogma as to what surpasses definite knowledge belongs to theology butbetween theology and science there is a no mans land exposed to attack from both sides this no mans land is philosophy almost all the questions of most interest to speculative minds aresuch as science cannot answer and the confident answers of theologians no longer seem soconvincing as they did in former centuries is the world divided into mind and matter and if sowhat is mind and what is matter is mind subject to matter or is it possessed of independentpowers has the universe any unity or

came to be not one protestantism but a multitude of sects not one philosophy opposed toscholasticism but as many as there were philosophers not as in the thirteenth century one emperor opposed to the pope but a large number of heretical kings the result in thought as inliterature was a continually deepening subjectivism operating at first as a wholesome liberationfrom spiritual slavery but advancing steadily towards a personal isolation inimical to socialsanity modern philosophy begins with descartes whose fundamental certainty is the existence ofhimself and his thoughts from which the external world is to be inferred this was only the firststage in a development through berkeley and kant to fichte for whom everything is only anemanation of the ego this was insanity and from this extreme philosophy has been attemptingever since to escape into the world of everyday common sense with subjectivism in philosophy anarchism in politics goes hand in hand already during lutherslifetime unwelcome and unacknowledged disciples had developed the doctrine of anabaptisnwhich for a time dominated the city of mnster the anabaptists repudiated all law since theyheld that the good man will be guided at every moment by the holy spirit who cannot be boundby formulas from this premiss they arrive at communism and sexual promiscuity they weretherefore exterminated after a heroic resistance but their doctrine in softened forms spread to holland england and america historically it is the source of quakerism a fiercer form ofanarchism no longer connected with religion arose in the nineteenth century in russia in spainand to a lesser degree in italy it had considerable success and to this day it remains a bugbear ofthe american immigration authorities this modern form though antireligious has still much ofthe spirit of early protestantism it differs mainly in directing against secular governments thehostility that luther directed against popes subjectivity once let loose could not be confined within limits until it had run its course inmorals the protestant emphasis on the individual conscience was essentially anarchic habit andcustom were so strong that except in occasional outbreaks such as that of munster the disciplesof individualism in ethics continued to act in a manner which was conventionally virtuous butthis was a precarious equilibrium the eighteenthcentury cult of sensibility began to break itdown an act was admired not for its good consequences or for its conformity to a moral code but for the emotion that inspired it out of this attitude developed thecult of the hero as it is expressed by carlyle and nietzsche and the byronic cult of violentpassion of no matter what kind the romantic movement in art in literature and in politics is bound up with this subjective wayof judging men not as members of a community but as aesthetically delightful objects ofcontemplation tigers are more beautiful than sheep but we prefer them behind bars the typicalromantic removes the bars and enjoys the magnificent leaps with which the tiger annihilates thesheep he exhorts men to imagine themselves tigers and when he succeeds the results are notwholly pleasant against the more insane forms of subjectivism in modern times there have been various reactions first a halfway compromise philosophy the doctrine of liberalism which attempted to assign therespective spheres of government and the individual this begins in its modern form with lockewho is as much opposed to enthusiasmthe individualism of the anabaptistsas to absoluteauthority and blind subservience to tradition a more thoroughgoing revolt leads to the doctrine of state worship which assigns to the state the position that catholicism gave to the church oreven sometimes to god hobbes rousseau and hegel represent different phases of this theoryand their doctrines are embodied practically in cromwell napoleon and modern germany communism in theory is far removed from such philosophies but is driven in practice to a typeof community very similar to that which results from state worship throughout this long development from bc to the present day philosophers have beendivided into those who wished to tighten social bonds and those who wished to relax them withthis difference others have been associated the disciplinarians have advocated some system ofdogma either old or new and have therefore been compelled to be in a greater or less degreehostile to science since their dogmas could not be proved empirically they have almostinvariably taught that happiness is not the good but that nobility or heroism is to be preferred they have had a sympathy with the irrational parts of human nature since they have felt reason tobe inimical to social cohesion the libertarians on the other hand with the exception of theextreme anarchists have tended to be scientific utilitarian rationalistic 
his endurance was simply marvellous when being cut off from our supplies we were compelledto go without foodon such occasions which often happen in time of war he was superior notonly to me but to everybody there was no one to be compared to him  his fortitude inenduring cold was also surprising there was a severe frost for the winter in that region is reallytremendous and everybody else either remained indoors or if they went out had on an amazingquantity of clothes and were well shod and had their feet swathed in felt and fleeces in the midstof this socrates with his bare feet on the ice and in his ordinary dress marched better than theother soldiers who had shoes and they looked daggers at him because he seemed to despise them his mastery over all bodily passions is constantly stressed he seldom drank wine but when hedid he could outdrink anybody no one had ever seen him drunk in love even under thestrongest temptations he remained platonic if plato is speaking the truth he was the perfect orphic saint in the dualism of heavenly soul and earthly body he had achieved the completemastery of the soul over the body his indifference to death at the last is the final proof of thismastery at the same time he is not an orthodox orphic it is only the fundamental doctrines thathe accepts not the superstitions and ceremonies of purification the platonic socrates anticipates both the stoics and the cynics the stoics held that the supremegood is virtue and that a man cannot be deprived of virtue by outside causes this doctrine isimplicit in the contention of socrates that his judges cannot harm him the cynics despisedworldly goods and showed their contempt by eschewing the comforts of civilization this is thesame point of view that led socrates to go barefoot and illclad it seems fairly certain that the preoccupations of socrates were ethical rather than scientific in the apology as we saw he says i have nothing to do with physical speculations the earliest of the platonic dialogues which are generally supposed to be the most socratic are mainly occupiedwith the search for definitions of ethical terms the charmides is concerned with the definition oftemperance or moderation the lysis with friendship the laches with courage in all of these noconclusion is arrived at but socrates makes it clear that he thinks it important to examine such questions the platonic socrates consistentlymaintains that he knows nothing and is only wiser than others in knowing that he knows nothingbut he does not think knowledge unobtainable on the contrary he thinks the search forknowledge of the utmost importance he maintains that no man sins wittingly and therefore onlyknowledge is needed to make all men perfectly virtuous the close connection between virtue and knowledge is characteristic of socrates and plato tosome degree it exists in all greek thought as opposed to that of christianity in christian ethics apure heart is the essential and is at least as likely to be found among the ignorant as among thelearned this difference between greek and christian ethics has persisted down to the present day dialectic that is to say the method of seeking knowledge by question and answer was notinvented by socrates it seems to have been first practised systematically by zeno the disciple of parmenides in platos dialogue parmenides zeno subjects socrates to the same kind of treatmentto which elsewhere in plato socrates subjects others but there is every reason to suppose that socrates practised and developed the method as we saw when socrates is condemned to deathhe reflects happily that in the next world he can go on asking questions for ever and cannot be putto death as he will be immortal certainly if he practised dialectic in the way described in the apology the hostility to him is easily explained all the humbugs in athens would combineagainst him the dialectic method is suitable for some questions and unsuitable for others perhaps this helpedto determine the character of platos inquiries which were for the most part such as could bedealt with in this way and through platos influence most subsequent philosophy has beenbounded by the limitations resulting from his method some matters are obviously unsuitable for treatment in this wayempirical science for example itis true that galileo used dialogues to advocate his theories but that was only in order to overcomeprejudicethe positive grounds for his discoveries could not be inserted in a dialogue withoutgreat artificiality socrates in platos works always pretends that he is only eliciting knowledgealready possessed by the man he is questioning on this ground he compares himself to a midwife when in the phaedo and the meno he applies his 
that he thinks it important to examine such questions the platonic socrates consistentlymaintains that he knows nothing and is only wiser than others in knowing that he knows nothingbut he does not think knowledge unobtainable on the contrary he thinks the search forknowledge of the utmost importance he maintains that no man sins wittingly and therefore onlyknowledge is needed to make all men perfectly virtuous the close connection between virtue and knowledge is characteristic of socrates and plato tosome degree it exists in all greek thought as opposed to that of christianity in christian ethics apure heart is the essential and is at least as likely to be found among the ignorant as among thelearned this difference between greek and christian ethics has persisted down to the present day dialectic that is to say the method of seeking knowledge by question and answer was notinvented by socrates it seems to have been first practised systematically by zeno the disciple of parmenides in platos dialogue parmenides zeno subjects socrates to the same kind of treatmentto which elsewhere in plato socrates subjects others but there is every reason to suppose that socrates practised and developed the method as we saw when socrates is condemned to deathhe reflects happily that in the next world he can go on asking questions for ever and cannot be putto death as he will be immortal certainly if he practised dialectic in the way described in the apology the hostility to him is easily explained all the humbugs in athens would combineagainst him the dialectic method is suitable for some questions and unsuitable for others perhaps this helpedto determine the character of platos inquiries which were for the most part such as could bedealt with in this way and through platos influence most subsequent philosophy has beenbounded by the limitations resulting from his method some matters are obviously unsuitable for treatment in this wayempirical science for example itis true that galileo used dialogues to advocate his theories but that was only in order to overcomeprejudicethe positive grounds for his discoveries could not be inserted in a dialogue withoutgreat artificiality socrates in platos works always pretends that he is only eliciting knowledgealready possessed by the man he is questioning on this ground he compares himself to a midwife when in the phaedo and the meno he applies his method to geometrical problems he has to ask leading questions which any judge would disallow the method is in harmony with the doctrine of reminiscence according to which we learn byremembering what we knew in a former existence as against this view consider any discoverythat has been made by means of the microscope say the spread of diseases by bacteria it canhardly be maintained that such knowledge can be elicited from a previously ignorant person by themethod of question and answer the matters that are suitable for treatment by the socratic method are those as to which we havealready enough knowledge to come to a right conclusion but have failed through confusion ofthought or lack of analysis to make the best logical use of what we know a question such aswhat is justice is eminently suited for discussion in a platonic dialogue we all freely use thewords just and unjust and by examining the ways in which we use them we can arriveinductively at the definition that will best suit with usage all that is needed is knowledge of howthe words in question are used but when our inquiry is concluded we have made only a linguisticdiscovery not a discovery in ethics we can however apply the method profitably to a somewhat larger class of cases wherever whatis being debated is logical rather than factual discussion is a good method of eliciting truth suppose some one maintains for example that democracy is good but persons holding certainopinions should not be allowed to vote we may convict him of inconsistency and prove to himthat at least one of his two assertions must be more or less erroneous logical errors are i think ofgreater practical importance than many people believe they enable their perpetrators to hold thecomfortable opinion on every subject in turn any logically coherent body of doctrine is sure to bein part painful and contrary to current prejudices the dialectic method or more generally thehabit of unfettered discussiontends to promote logical consistency and is in this way useful butit is quite unavailing when the object is to discover new facts perhaps philosophy might bedefined as the sumtotal of those inquiries that can be pursued by platos methods but if thisdefinition is appropriate that is because of platos influence upon subsequent philosophers 
method to geometrical problems he has to ask leading questions which any judge would disallow the method is in harmony with the doctrine of reminiscence according to which we learn byremembering what we knew in a former existence as against this view consider any discoverythat has been made by means of the microscope say the spread of diseases by bacteria it canhardly be maintained that such knowledge can be elicited from a previously ignorant person by themethod of question and answer the matters that are suitable for treatment by the socratic method are those as to which we havealready enough knowledge to come to a right conclusion but have failed through confusion ofthought or lack of analysis to make the best logical use of what we know a question such aswhat is justice is eminently suited for discussion in a platonic dialogue we all freely use thewords just and unjust and by examining the ways in which we use them we can arriveinductively at the definition that will best suit with usage all that is needed is knowledge of howthe words in question are used but when our inquiry is concluded we have made only a linguisticdiscovery not a discovery in ethics we can however apply the method profitably to a somewhat larger class of cases wherever whatis being debated is logical rather than factual discussion is a good method of eliciting truth suppose some one maintains for example that democracy is good but persons holding certainopinions should not be allowed to vote we may convict him of inconsistency and prove to himthat at least one of his two assertions must be more or less erroneous logical errors are i think ofgreater practical importance than many people believe they enable their perpetrators to hold thecomfortable opinion on every subject in turn any logically coherent body of doctrine is sure to bein part painful and contrary to current prejudices the dialectic method or more generally thehabit of unfettered discussiontends to promote logical consistency and is in this way useful butit is quite unavailing when the object is to discover new facts perhaps philosophy might bedefined as the sumtotal of those inquiries that can be pursued by platos methods but if thisdefinition is appropriate that is because of platos influence upon subsequent philosophers chapter xii the influence of sparta to understand plato and indeed many later philosophers it is necessary to know something of sparta sparta had a double effect on greek thought through the reality and through the myth each is important the reality enabled the spartans to defeat athens in war the myth influenced platos political theory and that of countless subsequent writers the myth fully developed isto be found in plutarch life of lycurgus the ideals that it favours have had a great part inframing the doctrines of rousseau nietzsche and national socialism the myth is of evenmore importance historically than the reality nevertheless we will begin with the latter forthe reality was the source of the myth laconia or lacedaemon of which sparta was the capital occupied the southeast of the peloponnesus the spartans who were the ruling race had conquered the country at the time ofthe dorian invasion from the north and had reduced the population that they found there to thecondition of serfs these serfs were called helots in historical times all the land belonged tothe spartans who however were forbidden by law and custom to cultivate it themselves bothon the ground that such labour was degrading and in order that they might always be free formilitary service the serfs were not bought and sold but remained attached to the land whichwas divided into lots one or more for each adult male spartan these lots like the helots couldnot be bought or sold and passed by law from father to son the landowner received from the helot who cultivated the lot seventy medimni of grain for himself twelve for his wife and a stated  not to mention dr thomas arnold and the english public schools

children from the first were subjected to a severe hardening process in some respects goodforexample they were not put in swaddling clothes at the age of seven boys were taken away fromhome and put in a boarding school where they were divided into companies each under theorders of one of their number chosen for sense and courage touching learning they had asmuch as served their turn for the rest of their time they spent in learning how to obey to awaywith pain to endure labour to overcome still in fight they played naked together most of thetime after twelve years old they wore no coats they were always nasty and sluttish and theynever bathed except on certain days in the year they slept on beds of straw which in winter theymixed with thistle they were taught to steal and were punished if caughtnot for stealing butfor stupidity homosexual love both male and female was a recognized custom in sparta and had anacknowledged part in the education of adolescent boys a boys lover suffered credit or discreditby the boys actions plutarch states that once when a boy cried out because he was hurt infighting his lover was fined for the boys cowardice there was little liberty at any stage in the life of a spartan their discipline and order of life continued still after they were full grown men for it was notlawful for any man to live as he listed but they were within their city as if they had been in acamp where every man knoweth what allowance he hath to live withal and what business he hathelse to do in his calling to be short they were all of this mind that they were not born to servethemselves but to serve their country  one of the best and happiest things which lycurgusever brought into his city was the great rest and leisure which he made his citizens to have onlyforbidding them that they should not profess any vile or base occupation and they needed not alsoto be careful to get great riches in a place where goods were nothing profitable nor esteemed forthe helots which were bond men made by the wars did till their grounds and yielded them acertain revenue every year plutarch goes on to tell a story of an athenian condemned for idleness upon hearing of which a spartan exclaimed show me the man condemned for living nobly and like a gentleman lycurgus did accustom his citizens so that they neither would nor couldlive alone but were in manner as men incorporated one with another and were always incompany together as the bees be about their master bee spartans were not allowed to travel nor were foreigners admitted to sparta except on businessfor it was feared that alien customs would corrupt lacedaemonian virtue plutarch relates the law that allowed spartans to kill helots whenever they felt so disposed butrefuses to believe that anything so abominable can have been due to lycurgus for i cannot bepersuaded that ever lycurgus invented or instituted so wicked and mischievous an act as thatkind of ordinance was because i imagine his nature was gentle and merciful by the clemency andjustice we see he used in all his other doings except in this matter plutarch has nothing butpraise for the constitution of sparta the effect of sparta on plato with whom at the moment we shall be specially concerned will beevident from the account of his utopia which will occupy the next chapter chapter xiii the sources of platos opinions plato and aristotle were the most influential of all philosophers ancient medieval or modernand of the two it was plato who had the greater effect upon subsequent ages i say this for tworeasons first that aristotle himself is an outcome of plato second that christian theology andphilosophy at any rate until the thirteenth century was much more platonic than aristotelian it isnecessary therefore in a history of philosophic thought to treat plato and to a lesser degree aristotle more fully than any of their predecessors or successors the most important matters in platos philosophy are first his utopia which was the earliest of along series second his theory of 
lycurgus did accustom his citizens so that they neither would nor couldlive alone but were in manner as men incorporated one with another and were always incompany together as the bees be about their master bee spartans were not allowed to travel nor were foreigners admitted to sparta except on businessfor it was feared that alien customs would corrupt lacedaemonian virtue plutarch relates the law that allowed spartans to kill helots whenever they felt so disposed butrefuses to believe that anything so abominable can have been due to lycurgus for i cannot bepersuaded that ever lycurgus invented or instituted so wicked and mischievous an act as thatkind of ordinance was because i imagine his nature was gentle and merciful by the clemency andjustice we see he used in all his other doings except in this matter plutarch has nothing butpraise for the constitution of sparta the effect of sparta on plato with whom at the moment we shall be specially concerned will beevident from the account of his utopia which will occupy the next chapter chapter xiii the sources of platos opinions plato and aristotle were the most influential of all philosophers ancient medieval or modernand of the two it was plato who had the greater effect upon subsequent ages i say this for tworeasons first that aristotle himself is an outcome of plato second that christian theology andphilosophy at any rate until the thirteenth century was much more platonic than aristotelian it isnecessary therefore in a history of philosophic thought to treat plato and to a lesser degree aristotle more fully than any of their predecessors or successors the most important matters in platos philosophy are first his utopia which was the earliest of along series second his theory of ideas which was a pioneer attempt to deal with the still unsolved problem of universals third hisarguments in favour of immortality fourth his cosmogony fifth his conception of knowledge asreminiscence rather than perception but before dealing with any of these topics i shall say a fewwords about the circumstances of his life and the influences which determined his political andphilosophical opinions plato was born in bc in the early years of the peloponnesian war he was a welltodoaristocrat related to various people who were concerned in the rule of the thirty tyrants he wasa young man when athens was defeated and he could attribute the defeat to democracy which hissocial position and his family connections were likely to make him despise he was a pupil of socrates for whom he had a profound affection and respect and socrates was put to death by thedemocracy it is not therefore surprising that he should turn to sparta for an adumbration of hisideal commonwealth plato possessed the art to dress up illiberal suggestions in such a way thatthey deceived future ages which admired the republic without ever becoming aware of what wasinvolved in its proposals it has always been correct to praise plato but not to understand him this is the common fate of great men my object is the opposite i wish to understand him but totreat him with as little reverence as if he were a contemporary english or american advocate oftotalitarianism the purely philosophical influences on plato were also such as to predispose him in favour of sparta these influences speaking broadly were pythagoras parmenides heraclitus and socrates from pythagoras plato derived the orphic elements in hisphilosophy the religious trend the belief in immortality the otherworldliness the priestly toneand all that is involved in the simile of the cave also his respect for mathematics and his intimateintermingling of intellect and mysticism from parmenides he derived the belief that reality is eternal and timeless and that on logicalgrounds all change must be illusory from heraclitus he derived the negative doctrine that there is nothing permanent in the sensibleworld this combined with the doctrine of parmenides led to the conclusion that knowledge isnot 
ideas which was a pioneer attempt to deal with the still unsolved problem of universals third hisarguments in favour of immortality fourth his cosmogony fifth his conception of knowledge asreminiscence rather than perception but before dealing with any of these topics i shall say a fewwords about the circumstances of his life and the influences which determined his political andphilosophical opinions plato was born in bc in the early years of the peloponnesian war he was a welltodoaristocrat related to various people who were concerned in the rule of the thirty tyrants he wasa young man when athens was defeated and he could attribute the defeat to democracy which hissocial position and his family connections were likely to make him despise he was a pupil of socrates for whom he had a profound affection and respect and socrates was put to death by thedemocracy it is not therefore surprising that he should turn to sparta for an adumbration of hisideal commonwealth plato possessed the art to dress up illiberal suggestions in such a way thatthey deceived future ages which admired the republic without ever becoming aware of what wasinvolved in its proposals it has always been correct to praise plato but not to understand him this is the common fate of great men my object is the opposite i wish to understand him but totreat him with as little reverence as if he were a contemporary english or american advocate oftotalitarianism the purely philosophical influences on plato were also such as to predispose him in favour of sparta these influences speaking broadly were pythagoras parmenides heraclitus and socrates from pythagoras plato derived the orphic elements in hisphilosophy the religious trend the belief in immortality the otherworldliness the priestly toneand all that is involved in the simile of the cave also his respect for mathematics and his intimateintermingling of intellect and mysticism from parmenides he derived the belief that reality is eternal and timeless and that on logicalgrounds all change must be illusory from heraclitus he derived the negative doctrine that there is nothing permanent in the sensibleworld this combined with the doctrine of parmenides led to the conclusion that knowledge isnot to be derived from the senses but is only to be achieved by the intellect this in turn fitted in wellwith pythagoreanism from socrates he probably learnt his preoccupation with ethical problems and his tendency toseek teleological rather than mechanical explanations of the world the good dominated histhought more than that of the pre socratics and it is difficult not to attribute this fact to theinfluence of socrates how is all this connected with authoritarianism in politics in the first place goodness and reality being timeless the best state will be the one which mostnearly copies the heavenly model by having a minimum of change and a maximum of staticperfection and its rulers should be those who best understand the eternal good in the second place plato like all mystics has in his beliefs a core of certainty which isessentially incommunicable except by a way of life the pythagoreans had endeavoured to set upa rule of the initiate and this is at bottom what plato desires if a man is to be a good statesmanhe must know the good this he can only do by a combination of intellectual and moral discipline if those who have not gone through this discipline are allowed a share in the government theywill inevitably corrupt k in the third place much education is needed to make a good ruler on platos principles it seems tous unwise to have insisted on teaching geometry to the younger dionysius tyrant of syracuse inorder to make him a good king but from platos point of view it was essential he was sufficiently pythagorean to think that without mathematics no true wisdom is possible this view implies anoligarchy in the fourth place plato in common with most greek philosophers took the view that leisure isessential to wisdom which will therefore not be found among those who have to work for theirliving but only among those who have independent means or who are relieved by the state fromanxieties as to their subsistence this point of view is essentially aristocratic two general questions arise in confronting plato with modem ideas the first is is there such athing as wisdom the second is granted that there is such a thing can any constitution bedevised that will give it political power wisdom in the sense supposed would not be any kind of specialized skill such as is possessedby the shoemaker or the physician 
to be derived from the senses but is only to be achieved by the intellect this in turn fitted in wellwith pythagoreanism from socrates he probably learnt his preoccupation with ethical problems and his tendency toseek teleological rather than mechanical explanations of the world the good dominated histhought more than that of the pre socratics and it is difficult not to attribute this fact to theinfluence of socrates how is all this connected with authoritarianism in politics in the first place goodness and reality being timeless the best state will be the one which mostnearly copies the heavenly model by having a minimum of change and a maximum of staticperfection and its rulers should be those who best understand the eternal good in the second place plato like all mystics has in his beliefs a core of certainty which isessentially incommunicable except by a way of life the pythagoreans had endeavoured to set upa rule of the initiate and this is at bottom what plato desires if a man is to be a good statesmanhe must know the good this he can only do by a combination of intellectual and moral discipline if those who have not gone through this discipline are allowed a share in the government theywill inevitably corrupt k in the third place much education is needed to make a good ruler on platos principles it seems tous unwise to have insisted on teaching geometry to the younger dionysius tyrant of syracuse inorder to make him a good king but from platos point of view it was essential he was sufficiently pythagorean to think that without mathematics no true wisdom is possible this view implies anoligarchy in the fourth place plato in common with most greek philosophers took the view that leisure isessential to wisdom which will therefore not be found among those who have to work for theirliving but only among those who have independent means or who are relieved by the state fromanxieties as to their subsistence this point of view is essentially aristocratic two general questions arise in confronting plato with modem ideas the first is is there such athing as wisdom the second is granted that there is such a thing can any constitution bedevised that will give it political power wisdom in the sense supposed would not be any kind of specialized skill such as is possessedby the shoemaker or the physician or the military tactician it must be something more generalized than this since its possession issupposed to make a man capable of governing wisely i think plato would have said that itconsists in knowledge of the good and would have supplemented this definition with the socraticdoctrine that no man sins wittingly from which it follows that whoever knows what is good doeswhat is right to us such a view seems remote from reality we should more naturally say thatthere are divergent interests and that the statesman should arrive at the best availablecompromise the members of a class or a nation may have a common interest but it will usuallyconflict with the interests of other classes or other nations there are no doubt some interests ofmankind as a whole but they do not suffice to determine political action perhaps they will do soat some future date but certainly not so long as there are many sovereign states and even thenthe most difficult part of the pursuit of the general interest would consist in arriving atcompromises among mutually hostile special interests but even if we suppose that there is such a thing as wisdom is there any form of constitutionwhich will give the government to the wise it is clear that majorities like general councils mayerr and in fact have erred aristocracies are not always wise kings are often foolish popes inspite of infallibility have committed grievous errors would anybody advocate entrusting thegovernment to university graduates or even to doctors of divinity or to men who having beenborn poor have made great fortunes it is clear that no legally definable selection of citizens islikely to be wiser in practice than the whole body it might be suggested that men could be given political wisdom by a suitable training but thequestion would arise what is a suitable training and this would turn out to be a party question the problem of finding a collection of wise men and leaving the government to them is thus aninsoluble one that is the ultimate reason for democracy 
or the military tactician it must be something more generalized than this since its possession issupposed to make a man capable of governing wisely i think plato would have said that itconsists in knowledge of the good and would have supplemented this definition with the socraticdoctrine that no man sins wittingly from which it follows that whoever knows what is good doeswhat is right to us such a view seems remote from reality we should more naturally say thatthere are divergent interests and that the statesman should arrive at the best availablecompromise the members of a class or a nation may have a common interest but it will usuallyconflict with the interests of other classes or other nations there are no doubt some interests ofmankind as a whole but they do not suffice to determine political action perhaps they will do soat some future date but certainly not so long as there are many sovereign states and even thenthe most difficult part of the pursuit of the general interest would consist in arriving atcompromises among mutually hostile special interests but even if we suppose that there is such a thing as wisdom is there any form of constitutionwhich will give the government to the wise it is clear that majorities like general councils mayerr and in fact have erred aristocracies are not always wise kings are often foolish popes inspite of infallibility have committed grievous errors would anybody advocate entrusting thegovernment to university graduates or even to doctors of divinity or to men who having beenborn poor have made great fortunes it is clear that no legally definable selection of citizens islikely to be wiser in practice than the whole body it might be suggested that men could be given political wisdom by a suitable training but thequestion would arise what is a suitable training and this would turn out to be a party question the problem of finding a collection of wise men and leaving the government to them is thus aninsoluble one that is the ultimate reason for democracy chapter xiv platos utopia platos most important dialogue the republic consists broadly of three parts the first consists in the construction of an ideal commonwealth it is the earliest of utopias one of the conclusions arrived at is that the rulers must be philosophers books vi and vii areconcerned to define the word philosopher this discussion constitutes the second section the third section consists of a discussion of various kinds of actual constitutions and of theirmerits and defects the nominal purpose of the republic is to define justice but at an early stage it is decided thatsince everything is easier to see in the large than in the small it will be better to inquire whatmakes a just state than what makes a just individual and since justice must be among theattributes of the best imaginable state such a state is first delineated and then it is decided whichof its perfections is to be called justice let us first describe platos utopia in its broad outlines and then consider points that arise by theway plato begins by deciding that the citizens are to be divided into three classes the common peoplethe soldiers and the guardians the last alone are to have political power there are to be muchfewer of them than of the other two classes in the first instance it seems they are to be chosen bythe legislator after that they will usually succeed by heredity but in exceptional cases apromising child may be promoted from one of the inferior classes while among the children ofguardians a child or young man who is unsatisfactory may be degraded the main problem as plato perceives is to insure that the guardians shall carry out the intentionsof the legislator for this purpose he has 
chapter xiv platos utopia platos most important dialogue the republic consists broadly of three parts the first consists in the construction of an ideal commonwealth it is the earliest of utopias one of the conclusions arrived at is that the rulers must be philosophers books vi and vii areconcerned to define the word philosopher this discussion constitutes the second section the third section consists of a discussion of various kinds of actual constitutions and of theirmerits and defects the nominal purpose of the republic is to define justice but at an early stage it is decided thatsince everything is easier to see in the large than in the small it will be better to inquire whatmakes a just state than what makes a just individual and since justice must be among theattributes of the best imaginable state such a state is first delineated and then it is decided whichof its perfections is to be called justice let us first describe platos utopia in its broad outlines and then consider points that arise by theway plato begins by deciding that the citizens are to be divided into three classes the common peoplethe soldiers and the guardians the last alone are to have political power there are to be muchfewer of them than of the other two classes in the first instance it seems they are to be chosen bythe legislator after that they will usually succeed by heredity but in exceptional cases apromising child may be promoted from one of the inferior classes while among the children ofguardians a child or young man who is unsatisfactory may be degraded the main problem as plato perceives is to insure that the guardians shall carry out the intentionsof the legislator for this purpose he has various proposals educational economic biological and religious it is not always clear how farthese proposals apply to other classes than the guardians it is clear that some of them apply to thesoldiers but in the main plato is concerned only with the guardians who are to be a class apartlike the jesuits in old paraguay the ecclesiastics in the states of the church until and the communist party in the ussr at the present day the first thing to consider is education this is divided into two parts music and gymnastics eachhas a wider meaning than at present music means everything that is in the province of themuses and gymnastics means everything concerned with physical training and fitness musicis almost as wide as what we should call culture and gymnastics is somewhat wider than whatwe call athletics culture is to be devoted to making men gentlemen in the sense which largely owing to plato isfamiliar in england the athens of his day was in one respect analogous to england in thenineteenth century there was in each an aristocracy enjoying wealth and social prestige buthaving no monopoly of political power and in each the aristocracy had to secure as much poweras it could by means of impressive behaviour in platos utopia however the aristocracy rulesunchecked gravity decorum and courage seem to be the qualities mainly to be cultivated in education thereis to be a rigid censorship from very early years over the literature to which the young haveaccess and the music they are allowed to hear mothers and nurses are to tell their children onlyauthorized stories homer and hesiod are not to be allowed for a number of reasons first theyrepresent the gods as behaving badly on occasion which is unedifying the young must be taughtthat evils never come from the gods for god is not the author of all things but only of goodthings second there are things in homer and hesiod which are calculated to make their readersfear death whereas everything ought to be done in education to make young people willing to diein battle our boys must be taught to consider slavery worse than death and therefore they musthave no stories of good men weeping and wailing even for the death of friends third decorumdemands that there should never be loud laughter and yet homer speaks of inextinguishablelaughter 
various proposals educational economic biological and religious it is not always clear how farthese proposals apply to other classes than the guardians it is clear that some of them apply to thesoldiers but in the main plato is concerned only with the guardians who are to be a class apartlike the jesuits in old paraguay the ecclesiastics in the states of the church until and the communist party in the ussr at the present day the first thing to consider is education this is divided into two parts music and gymnastics eachhas a wider meaning than at present music means everything that is in the province of themuses and gymnastics means everything concerned with physical training and fitness musicis almost as wide as what we should call culture and gymnastics is somewhat wider than whatwe call athletics culture is to be devoted to making men gentlemen in the sense which largely owing to plato isfamiliar in england the athens of his day was in one respect analogous to england in thenineteenth century there was in each an aristocracy enjoying wealth and social prestige buthaving no monopoly of political power and in each the aristocracy had to secure as much poweras it could by means of impressive behaviour in platos utopia however the aristocracy rulesunchecked gravity decorum and courage seem to be the qualities mainly to be cultivated in education thereis to be a rigid censorship from very early years over the literature to which the young haveaccess and the music they are allowed to hear mothers and nurses are to tell their children onlyauthorized stories homer and hesiod are not to be allowed for a number of reasons first theyrepresent the gods as behaving badly on occasion which is unedifying the young must be taughtthat evils never come from the gods for god is not the author of all things but only of goodthings second there are things in homer and hesiod which are calculated to make their readersfear death whereas everything ought to be done in education to make young people willing to diein battle our boys must be taught to consider slavery worse than death and therefore they musthave no stories of good men weeping and wailing even for the death of friends third decorumdemands that there should never be loud laughter and yet homer speaks of inextinguishablelaughter among the blessed gods how is a schoolmaster to reprove mirth effectively if boys can quotethis passage fourth there are passages in homer praising rich feasts and others describing thelusts of the gods such passages discourage temperance then there must be no stories in which the wickedare happy or the good unhappy the moral effect on tender minds might be most unfortunate onall these counts the poets are to be condemned plato passes on to a curious argument about the drama the good man he says ought to beunwilling to imitate a bad man now most plays contain villains therefore the dramatist and theactor who plays the villains part have to imitate people guilty of various crimes not onlycriminals but women slaves and inferiors generally ought not to be imitated by superior men plays therefore ifpermissible at all must contain no characters except faultless male heroes of good birth theimpossibility of this is so evident that plato decides to banish all dramatists from his city when any of these pantomimic gentlemen who are so clever that they can imitate anythingcomes to us and makes a proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down andworship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist the law will not allow them and so when we haveanointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send him away toanother city next we come to the censorship of music the lydian and ionian harmoniesare to be forbidden the first because it expresses sorrow the second because it is relaxed onlythe dorian and the phrygian are to be allowed permissible rhythmsmust be simple and such as are expressive of a courageous and harmonious life the training of the body is to be very austere no one is to eat fish or meat cooked otherwise thanroasted and there must be no sauces or confectionery people brought up on his regimen he sayswill have no need of doctors 
among the blessed gods how is a schoolmaster to reprove mirth effectively if boys can quotethis passage fourth there are passages in homer praising rich feasts and others describing thelusts of the gods such passages discourage temperance then there must be no stories in which the wickedare happy or the good unhappy the moral effect on tender minds might be most unfortunate onall these counts the poets are to be condemned plato passes on to a curious argument about the drama the good man he says ought to beunwilling to imitate a bad man now most plays contain villains therefore the dramatist and theactor who plays the villains part have to imitate people guilty of various crimes not onlycriminals but women slaves and inferiors generally ought not to be imitated by superior men plays therefore ifpermissible at all must contain no characters except faultless male heroes of good birth theimpossibility of this is so evident that plato decides to banish all dramatists from his city when any of these pantomimic gentlemen who are so clever that they can imitate anythingcomes to us and makes a proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down andworship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist the law will not allow them and so when we haveanointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send him away toanother city next we come to the censorship of music the lydian and ionian harmoniesare to be forbidden the first because it expresses sorrow the second because it is relaxed onlythe dorian and the phrygian are to be allowed permissible rhythmsmust be simple and such as are expressive of a courageous and harmonious life the training of the body is to be very austere no one is to eat fish or meat cooked otherwise thanroasted and there must be no sauces or confectionery people brought up on his regimen he sayswill have no need of doctors up to a certain age the young are to see no ugliness or vice but at a suitable moment theymust be exposed to enchantments both in the shape of terrors that must not terrify and of badpleasures that must not seduce the will only after they have withstood these tests will they bejudged fit to be guardians young boys before they are grown up should see war though they should not themselvesfight as for economics plato proposes a thoroughgoing communism for the guardians and also for the soldiers though this is not very clear the guardians are to have small houses andsimple food they are to live as in a camp dining together in companies they are to have noprivate property beyond what is absolutely necessary gold and silver are to be forbidden though not rich there is no reason why they should not be happy but the purpose of the city isthe good of the whole not the happiness of one class both wealth and poverty are harmful andin platos city neither will exist there is a curious argument about war that it will be easy topurchase allies since our city will not want any share in the spoils of victory with feigned unwillingness the platonic socrates proceeds to apply his communism to thefamily friends he says should have all things in common including women and children headmits that this presents difficulties but thinks them not insuperable first of all girls are tohave exactly the same education as boys learning music gymnastics and the art of war alongwith the boys women are to have complete equality with men in all respects the sameeducation which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian for theiroriginal nature is the same no doubt there are differences between men and women but theyhave nothing to do with politics some women are philosophic and suitable as guardians someare warlike and could make good soldiers the legislator having selected the guardians some men and some women will ordain that theyshall all share common houses and common meals marriage as we know it will be radicallytransformed at certain festivals brides and bridegrooms in such numbers as are required tokeep the population constant will be brought together by lot as they will be taught to believebut in fact the  these women shall be without exception the common wives of these men and no oneshall have a wife of his own 
hostile to violent passion and enemies of all the more profound forms of religion this conflictexisted in greece before the rise of what we recognize as philosophy and is already quite explicitin the earliest greek thought in changing forms it has persisted down to the present day and nodoubt will persist for many ages to come it is clear that each party to this disputeas to all that persist through long periods of timeispartly right and partly wrong social cohesion is a necessity and mankind has never yet succeededin enforcing cohesion by merely rational arguments every community is exposed to two oppositedangers ossification through too much discipline and reverence for tradition on the one hand onthe other hand dissolution or subjection to foreign conquest through the growth of anindividualism and personal independence that makes cooperation impossible in generalimportant civilizations start with a rigid and superstitious system gradually relaxed and leadingat a certain stage to a period of brilliant genius while the good of the old tradition remains andthe evil inherent in its dissolution has not yet developed but as the evil unfolds it leads toanarchy thence inevitably to a new tyranny producing a new synthesis secured by a new systemof dogma the doctrine of liberalism is an attempt to escape from this endless oscillation theessence of liberalism is an attempt to secure a social order not based on irrational dogma andinsuring stability without involving more restraints than are necessary for the preservation of thecommunity whether this attempt can succeed only the future can determine book one ancient philosophy part i the pre socratics chapter i the rise of greek civilization in all history nothing is so surprising or so difficult to account for as the sudden rise ofcivilization in greece much of what makes civilization had already existed for thousands ofyears in egypt and in mesopotamia and had spread thence to neighbouring countries butcertain elements had been lacking until the greeks supplied them what they achieved in artand literature is familiar to everybody but what they did in the purely intellectual realm is evenmore exceptional they invented mathematics and science and philosophy they first wrotehistory as opposed to mere annals they speculated freely about the nature of the world and theends of life without being bound in the fetters of any inherited orthodoxy what occurred wasso astonishing that until very recent times men were content to gape and talk mystically aboutthe greek genius it is possible however to understand the development of greece in scientificterms and it is well worth while to do so philosophy begins with thales who fortunately can be dated by the fact that he predicted aneclipse which according to the astronomers occurred in the year bc philosophy andsciencewhich were not originally separatewere therefore born together at the beginning ofthe sixth century what had been happening in greece and neighbouring countries before thistime any answer must be in  arithmetic and some geometry existed among the egyptians and babylonians but mainlyin the form of rules of thumb deductive reasoning from general premisses was a greekinnovation 
up to a certain age the young are to see no ugliness or vice but at a suitable moment theymust be exposed to enchantments both in the shape of terrors that must not terrify and of badpleasures that must not seduce the will only after they have withstood these tests will they bejudged fit to be guardians young boys before they are grown up should see war though they should not themselvesfight as for economics plato proposes a thoroughgoing communism for the guardians and also for the soldiers though this is not very clear the guardians are to have small houses andsimple food they are to live as in a camp dining together in companies they are to have noprivate property beyond what is absolutely necessary gold and silver are to be forbidden though not rich there is no reason why they should not be happy but the purpose of the city isthe good of the whole not the happiness of one class both wealth and poverty are harmful andin platos city neither will exist there is a curious argument about war that it will be easy topurchase allies since our city will not want any share in the spoils of victory with feigned unwillingness the platonic socrates proceeds to apply his communism to thefamily friends he says should have all things in common including women and children headmits that this presents difficulties but thinks them not insuperable first of all girls are tohave exactly the same education as boys learning music gymnastics and the art of war alongwith the boys women are to have complete equality with men in all respects the sameeducation which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian for theiroriginal nature is the same no doubt there are differences between men and women but theyhave nothing to do with politics some women are philosophic and suitable as guardians someare warlike and could make good soldiers the legislator having selected the guardians some men and some women will ordain that theyshall all share common houses and common meals marriage as we know it will be radicallytransformed at certain festivals brides and bridegrooms in such numbers as are required tokeep the population constant will be brought together by lot as they will be taught to believebut in fact the  these women shall be without exception the common wives of these men and no oneshall have a wife of his own rulers of the city will manipulate the lots on eugenic principles they will arrange that the bestsires shall have the most children all children will be taken away from their parents at birthand great care will be taken that no parents shall know who are their children and no childrenshall know who are their parents deformed children and children of inferior parents will beput away in some mysterious unknown place as they ought to be children arising from unionsnot sanctioned by the state are to be considered illegitimate mothers are to be between twentyand forty fathers between twentyfive and fiftyfive outside these ages intercourse is to befree but abortion or infanticide is to be compulsory in the marriages arranged by the statethe people concerned have no voice they are to be actuated by the thought of their duty to the state not by any of those common emotions that the banished poets used to celebrate since no one knows who his parents are he is to call every one father whose age is such thathe might be his father and similarly as regards mother and brother and sister there is to be nomarriage between a father and daughter or mother and son in general but notabsolutely marriages of brother and sister are to be prevented it is supposed that the sentiments at present attached to the words father mother son anddaughter will still attach to them under platos new arrangements a young man for instancewill not strike an old man because he might be striking his father the advantage sought is of course to minimize private possessive emotions and so removeobstacles to the domination of public spirit as well as to acquiescence in the absence of privateproperty it was largely motives of a similar kind that led to the celibacy of the clergy i come last to the theological aspect of the system i am not thinking of the accepted greekgods but of certain myths which the government is to inculcate lying plato says explicity isto be a prerogative  see henry c lea a history of sacerdotal celibacy

of the government just as giving medicine is of physicians the government as we have alreadyseen is to deceive people in pretending to arrange marriages by lot but this is not a religiousmatter there is to be one royal lie which plato hopes may deceive the rulers but will at any ratedeceive the rest of the city this lie is set forth in considerable detail the most important part ofit is the dogma that god has created men of three kinds the best made of gold the second best ofsilver and the common herd of brass and iron those made of gold are fit to be guardians thosemade of silver should be soldiers the others should do the manual work usually but by no meansalways children will belong to the same grade as their parents when they do not they must bepromoted or degraded accordingly it is thought hardly possible to make the present generationbelieve this myth but the next and all subsequent generations can be so educated as not to doubtit plato is fight in thinking that belief in this myth could be generated in two generations the japanese have been taught that the mikado is descended from the sungoddess and that japan wascreated earlier than the rest of the world any university professor who even in a learned workthrows doubt on these dogmas is dismissed for un japanese activities what plato does not seemto realize is that the compulsory acceptance of such myths is incompatible with philosophy andinvolves a kind of education which stunts intelligence the definition of justice which is the nominal goal of the whole discussion is reached in book iv it consists we are told in everybody doing his own work and not being a busybody the city isjust when trader auxiliary and guardian each does his own job without interfering with that ofother classes that everybody should mind his own business is no doubt an admirable precept but it hardlycorresponds to what a modern would naturally call justice the greek word so translatedcorresponded to a concept which was very important in greek thought but for which we have noexact equivalent it is worth while to recall what anaximander said into that from which things take their rise they pass away once more as is ordained for they makereparation and satisfaction to one another for their injustice according to the appointed time before philosophy began the greeks had a theory or feeling about the universe which may becalled religious or ethical according to this theory every person and every thing has his or itsappointed place and appointed function this does not depend upon the fiat of zeus for zeushimself is subject to the same kind of law as governs others the theory is connected with the ideaof fate or necessity it applies emphatically to the heavenly bodies but where there is vigour thereis a tendency to overstep just bounds hence arises strife some kind of impersonal super olympian law punishes hubris and restores the eternal order which the aggressor sought toviolate this whole outlook originally perhaps scarcely conscious passed over into philosophyit is to be found alike in cosmologies of strife such as those of heraclitus and empedocles and inmonistic doctrines such as that of parmenides it is the source of the belief both in natural and inhuman law and it clearly underlies platos conception of justice the word justice as still used in the law is more similar to platos conception than it is as usedin political speculation under the influence of democratic theory we have come to associatejustice with equality while for plato it has no such implication justice in the sense in which itis almost synonymous with lawas when we speak of courts of justiceis concerned mainlywith property rights which have nothing to do with equality the first suggested definition ofjustice at the beginning of the republic is that it consists in paying debts this definition issoon abandoned as inadequate but something of it remains at the end there are several points to be noted about platos definition first it makes it possible to haveinequalities of power and privilege without injustice the guardians are to have all the powerbecause they are the wisest members of the community injustice would only occur on platosdefinition if there were men in the other classes who were wiser than some of the guardians thatis why plato provides for promotion and degradation of citizens although he thinks that thedouble advantage of birth and education will in most cases make the children of guardianssuperior to the children of others if there were a more exact science of government and morecertainty of men following its precepts there would be much to be said for platos system no onethinks it unjust to put the best men into a 
before philosophy began the greeks had a theory or feeling about the universe which may becalled religious or ethical according to this theory every person and every thing has his or itsappointed place and appointed function this does not depend upon the fiat of zeus for zeushimself is subject to the same kind of law as governs others the theory is connected with the ideaof fate or necessity it applies emphatically to the heavenly bodies but where there is vigour thereis a tendency to overstep just bounds hence arises strife some kind of impersonal super olympian law punishes hubris and restores the eternal order which the aggressor sought toviolate this whole outlook originally perhaps scarcely conscious passed over into philosophyit is to be found alike in cosmologies of strife such as those of heraclitus and empedocles and inmonistic doctrines such as that of parmenides it is the source of the belief both in natural and inhuman law and it clearly underlies platos conception of justice the word justice as still used in the law is more similar to platos conception than it is as usedin political speculation under the influence of democratic theory we have come to associatejustice with equality while for plato it has no such implication justice in the sense in which itis almost synonymous with lawas when we speak of courts of justiceis concerned mainlywith property rights which have nothing to do with equality the first suggested definition ofjustice at the beginning of the republic is that it consists in paying debts this definition issoon abandoned as inadequate but something of it remains at the end there are several points to be noted about platos definition first it makes it possible to haveinequalities of power and privilege without injustice the guardians are to have all the powerbecause they are the wisest members of the community injustice would only occur on platosdefinition if there were men in the other classes who were wiser than some of the guardians thatis why plato provides for promotion and degradation of citizens although he thinks that thedouble advantage of birth and education will in most cases make the children of guardianssuperior to the children of others if there were a more exact science of government and morecertainty of men following its precepts there would be much to be said for platos system no onethinks it unjust to put the best men into a football team although they acquire thereby a great superiority if football were managed asdemocratically as the athenian government the students to play for their university would bechosen by lot but in matters of government it is difficult to know who has the most skill and veryfar from certain that a politician will use his skill in the public interest rather than in his own or inthat of his class or party or creed the next point is that platos definition of justice presupposes a state organized either ontraditional lines or like his own so as to realize in its totality some ethical ideal justice we aretold consists in every man doing his own job but what is a mans job in a state which likeancient egypt or the kingdom of the incas remains unchanged generation after generation a mansjob is his fathers job and no question arises but in platos state no man has any legal father hisjob therefore must be decided either by his own tastes or by the states judgement as to hisaptitudes the latter is obviously what plato would desire but some kinds of work though highlyskilled may be deemed pernicious plato takes this view of poetry and i should take it of thework of napoleon the purposes of the government therefore are essential in determining what isa mans job although all the rulers are to be philosophers there are to be no innovations aphilosopher is to be for all time a man who understands and agrees with plato when we ask what will platos republic achieve the answer is rather humdrum it will achievesuccess in wars against roughly equal populations and it will secure a livelihood for a certainsmall number of people it will almost certainly produce no art or science because of its rigidityin this respect as in others it will be like sparta in spite of all the fine talk skill in war andenough to eat is all that will be achieved plato had lived through famine and defeat in athensperhaps subconsciously he thought the avoidance of these evils the best that statesmanship couldaccomplish a utopia if seriously intended obviously must embody the ideals of its creator let us considerfor a moment what we can mean by ideals in the first place they are desired by those whobelieve in them but they are not desired quite in the same way as a man desires personal comfortssuch as food and shelter what makes the difference between ideal and an ordinary object ofdesire is that the 
football team although they acquire thereby a great superiority if football were managed asdemocratically as the athenian government the students to play for their university would bechosen by lot but in matters of government it is difficult to know who has the most skill and veryfar from certain that a politician will use his skill in the public interest rather than in his own or inthat of his class or party or creed the next point is that platos definition of justice presupposes a state organized either ontraditional lines or like his own so as to realize in its totality some ethical ideal justice we aretold consists in every man doing his own job but what is a mans job in a state which likeancient egypt or the kingdom of the incas remains unchanged generation after generation a mansjob is his fathers job and no question arises but in platos state no man has any legal father hisjob therefore must be decided either by his own tastes or by the states judgement as to hisaptitudes the latter is obviously what plato would desire but some kinds of work though highlyskilled may be deemed pernicious plato takes this view of poetry and i should take it of thework of napoleon the purposes of the government therefore are essential in determining what isa mans job although all the rulers are to be philosophers there are to be no innovations aphilosopher is to be for all time a man who understands and agrees with plato when we ask what will platos republic achieve the answer is rather humdrum it will achievesuccess in wars against roughly equal populations and it will secure a livelihood for a certainsmall number of people it will almost certainly produce no art or science because of its rigidityin this respect as in others it will be like sparta in spite of all the fine talk skill in war andenough to eat is all that will be achieved plato had lived through famine and defeat in athensperhaps subconsciously he thought the avoidance of these evils the best that statesmanship couldaccomplish a utopia if seriously intended obviously must embody the ideals of its creator let us considerfor a moment what we can mean by ideals in the first place they are desired by those whobelieve in them but they are not desired quite in the same way as a man desires personal comfortssuch as food and shelter what makes the difference between ideal and an ordinary object ofdesire is that the former is impersonal it is something having no special reference to the ego ofthe man who feels the desire and therefore capable theoretically of being desired by everybody thus we might define an ideal as something desired not egocentric and such that the persondesiring it wishes that every one else also desired it i may wish that everybody had enough to eatthat everybody felt kindly towards everybody and so on and if i wish anything of this kind i shallalso wish others to wish it in this way i can build up what looks like an impersonal ethicalthough in fact it rests upon the personal basis of my own desiresfor the desire remains mineeven when what is desired has no reference to myself for example one man may wish thateverybody understood science and another that everybody appreciated art it is a personaldifference between the two men that produces this difference in their desires the personal element becomes apparent as soon as controversy is involved suppose some mansays you are wrong to wish everybody to be happy you ought to desire the happiness of germans and the unhappiness of everyone else here ought may be taken to mean that that iswhat the speaker wishes me to desire i might retort that not being german it is psychologicallyimpossible for me to desire the unhappiness of all non germans but this answer seemsinadequate again there may be a conflict of purely impersonal ideals nietzsches hero differs from a christian saint yet both are impersonally admired the one by nietzscheans the other by christians how are we to decide between the two except by means of our own desires yet ifthere is nothing further an ethical disagreement can only be decided by emotional appeals or byforcein the ultimate resort by war on questions of fact we can appeal to science and scientificmethods of observation but on ultimate questions of ethics there seems to be nothing analogous yet if this is really the case ethical disputes resolve themselves into contests for powerincluding propaganda power this point of view in a crude form is put forth in the first book of the republic by thrasymachuswho like almost all the characters in platos dialogues was a real person he was a sophist from chalcedon and a famous teacher of rhetoric he appeared in the first comedy of aristophanes bc after socrates has for some time been 
former is impersonal it is something having no special reference to the ego ofthe man who feels the desire and therefore capable theoretically of being desired by everybody thus we might define an ideal as something desired not egocentric and such that the persondesiring it wishes that every one else also desired it i may wish that everybody had enough to eatthat everybody felt kindly towards everybody and so on and if i wish anything of this kind i shallalso wish others to wish it in this way i can build up what looks like an impersonal ethicalthough in fact it rests upon the personal basis of my own desiresfor the desire remains mineeven when what is desired has no reference to myself for example one man may wish thateverybody understood science and another that everybody appreciated art it is a personaldifference between the two men that produces this difference in their desires the personal element becomes apparent as soon as controversy is involved suppose some mansays you are wrong to wish everybody to be happy you ought to desire the happiness of germans and the unhappiness of everyone else here ought may be taken to mean that that iswhat the speaker wishes me to desire i might retort that not being german it is psychologicallyimpossible for me to desire the unhappiness of all non germans but this answer seemsinadequate again there may be a conflict of purely impersonal ideals nietzsches hero differs from a christian saint yet both are impersonally admired the one by nietzscheans the other by christians how are we to decide between the two except by means of our own desires yet ifthere is nothing further an ethical disagreement can only be decided by emotional appeals or byforcein the ultimate resort by war on questions of fact we can appeal to science and scientificmethods of observation but on ultimate questions of ethics there seems to be nothing analogous yet if this is really the case ethical disputes resolve themselves into contests for powerincluding propaganda power this point of view in a crude form is put forth in the first book of the republic by thrasymachuswho like almost all the characters in platos dialogues was a real person he was a sophist from chalcedon and a famous teacher of rhetoric he appeared in the first comedy of aristophanes bc after socrates has for some time been amiably discussing justice with an old man named cephalus and with platos elder brothers glancon and adeimanms thrasymachus who has been listening with growing impatience breaksin with a vehement protest against such childish nonsense he proclaims emphatically that justiceis nothing else than the interest of the stronger this point of view is refuted by socrates with quibbles it is never fairly faced it raises thefundamental question in ethics and politics namely is there any standard of good and badexcept what the man using these words desires if there is not many of the consequences drawnby thrasymachus seem unescapable yet how are we to say that there is at this point religion has at first sight a simple answer god determines what is good and whatbad the man whose will is in harmony with the will of god is a good man yet this answer is notquite orthodox theologians say that god is good and this implies that there is a standard ofgoodness which is independent of gods will we are thus forced to face the question is thereobjective truth or falsehood in such a statement as pleasure is good in the same sense as in sucha statement as snow is white to answer this question a very long discussion would be necessary some may think that we canfor practical purposes evade the fundamental issue and say i do not know what is meant byobjective truth but i shall consider a statement true if all or virtually all of those who haveinvestigated it are agreed in upholding it in this sense it is true that snow is white that caesarwas assassinated that water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen and so on we are then facedwith a question of fact are there any similarly agreed statements in ethics if there are they can bemade the basis both for rules of private conduct and for a theory of politics if there are not weare driven in practice whatever may be the philosophic truth to a contest by force or propagandaor both whenever an irreconcilable ethical difference exists between powerful groups for plato this question does not really exist although his dramatic sense leads him to state theposition of thrasymachns forcibly he is quite unaware of its strength and allows himself to begrossly unfair in arguing against it plato is convinced that there is the good and that its naturecan be ascertained when people disagree 
amiably discussing justice with an old man named cephalus and with platos elder brothers glancon and adeimanms thrasymachus who has been listening with growing impatience breaksin with a vehement protest against such childish nonsense he proclaims emphatically that justiceis nothing else than the interest of the stronger this point of view is refuted by socrates with quibbles it is never fairly faced it raises thefundamental question in ethics and politics namely is there any standard of good and badexcept what the man using these words desires if there is not many of the consequences drawnby thrasymachus seem unescapable yet how are we to say that there is at this point religion has at first sight a simple answer god determines what is good and whatbad the man whose will is in harmony with the will of god is a good man yet this answer is notquite orthodox theologians say that god is good and this implies that there is a standard ofgoodness which is independent of gods will we are thus forced to face the question is thereobjective truth or falsehood in such a statement as pleasure is good in the same sense as in sucha statement as snow is white to answer this question a very long discussion would be necessary some may think that we canfor practical purposes evade the fundamental issue and say i do not know what is meant byobjective truth but i shall consider a statement true if all or virtually all of those who haveinvestigated it are agreed in upholding it in this sense it is true that snow is white that caesarwas assassinated that water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen and so on we are then facedwith a question of fact are there any similarly agreed statements in ethics if there are they can bemade the basis both for rules of private conduct and for a theory of politics if there are not weare driven in practice whatever may be the philosophic truth to a contest by force or propagandaor both whenever an irreconcilable ethical difference exists between powerful groups for plato this question does not really exist although his dramatic sense leads him to state theposition of thrasymachns forcibly he is quite unaware of its strength and allows himself to begrossly unfair in arguing against it plato is convinced that there is the good and that its naturecan be ascertained when people disagree about it one at least is making an intellectual error just as much as if the disagreement were ascientific one on some matter of fact the difference between plato and thrasymachus is very important but for the historian ofphilosophy it is one to be only noted not decided plato thinks he can prove that his ideal republic is good a democrat who accepts the objectivity of ethics may think that he can prove the republic bad but any one who agrees with thrasymachus will say there is no question ofproving or disproving the only question is whether you like the kind of state that plato desires ifyou do it is good for you if you do not it is bad for you if many do and many do not thedecision cannot be made by reason but only by force actual or concealed this is one of theissues in philosophy that are still open on each side there are men who command respect but fora very long time the opinion that plato advocated remained almost undisputed it should be observed further that the view which substitutes the consensus of opinion for anobjective standard has certain consequences that few would accept what are we to say ofscientific innovators like galileo who advocate an opinion with which few agree but finally winthe support of almost everybody they do so by means of arguments not by emotional appeals orstate propaganda or the use of force this implies a criterion other than the general opinion inethical matters there is something analogous in the case of the great religious teachers christtaught that it is not wrong to pluck ears of corn on the sabbath but that it is wrong to hate yourenemies such ethical innovations obviously imply some standard other than majority opinion butthe standard whatever it is is not objective fact as in a scientific question this problem is adifficult one and i do not profess to be able to solve it for the present let us be content to note it platos republic unlike modern utopias was perhaps intended to be actually founded this wasnot so fantastic or impossible as it might naturally seem to us many of its provisions includingsome that we should have thought quite impracticable were actually realized at sparta the ruleof philosophers had been attempted by pythagoras and in platos time archytas the pythagoreanwas politically influential in taras when plato visited sicily and southern italy it was a common practice for cities to employ a sage 
about it one at least is making an intellectual error just as much as if the disagreement were ascientific one on some matter of fact the difference between plato and thrasymachus is very important but for the historian ofphilosophy it is one to be only noted not decided plato thinks he can prove that his ideal republic is good a democrat who accepts the objectivity of ethics may think that he can prove the republic bad but any one who agrees with thrasymachus will say there is no question ofproving or disproving the only question is whether you like the kind of state that plato desires ifyou do it is good for you if you do not it is bad for you if many do and many do not thedecision cannot be made by reason but only by force actual or concealed this is one of theissues in philosophy that are still open on each side there are men who command respect but fora very long time the opinion that plato advocated remained almost undisputed it should be observed further that the view which substitutes the consensus of opinion for anobjective standard has certain consequences that few would accept what are we to say ofscientific innovators like galileo who advocate an opinion with which few agree but finally winthe support of almost everybody they do so by means of arguments not by emotional appeals orstate propaganda or the use of force this implies a criterion other than the general opinion inethical matters there is something analogous in the case of the great religious teachers christtaught that it is not wrong to pluck ears of corn on the sabbath but that it is wrong to hate yourenemies such ethical innovations obviously imply some standard other than majority opinion butthe standard whatever it is is not objective fact as in a scientific question this problem is adifficult one and i do not profess to be able to solve it for the present let us be content to note it platos republic unlike modern utopias was perhaps intended to be actually founded this wasnot so fantastic or impossible as it might naturally seem to us many of its provisions includingsome that we should have thought quite impracticable were actually realized at sparta the ruleof philosophers had been attempted by pythagoras and in platos time archytas the pythagoreanwas politically influential in taras when plato visited sicily and southern italy it was a common practice for cities to employ a sage to draw up their laws solon had done this for athens and protagoras for thurii colonies inthose days were completely free from control by their parent cities and it would have been quitefeasible for a band of platonists to establish the republic on the shores of spain or gaul unfortunately chance led plato to syracuse a great commercial city engaged in desperate warswith carthage in such an atmosphere no philosopher could have achieved much in the nextgeneration the rise of macedonia had made all small states antiquated and had brought about thefutility of all political experiments in miniature chapter xv the theory of ideas the middle of the republic from the later part of book v to the end of book vii is occupiedmainly with questions of pure philosophy as opposed to politics these questions are introducedby a somewhat abrupt statement until philosophers are kings or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power ofphilosophy and political greatness and wisdom meet in one and those commoner natures whopursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside cities will never have restfrom these evilsno nor the human race as i believeand then only will this our state have apossibility of life and behold the light of day if this is true we must decide what constitutes a philosopher and what we mean by philosophythe consequent discussion is the most famous part of the republic and has perhaps been the mostin fluential it has in parts extraordinary literary beauty the reader may disagree withwhat is said but cannot help being moved by it platos philosophy rests on the distinction between reality and appearance which was first setforth by parmenides throughout the

discussion with which we are now concerned parmenidean phrases and arguments are constantlyrecurring there is however a religious tone about reality which is rather pythagorean than parmenidean and there is much about mathematics and music which is directly traceable to thedisciples of pythagoras this combination of the logic of parmenides with the otherworldliness of pythagoras and the orphics produced a doctrine which was felt to be satisfying to both theintellect and the religious emotions the result was a very powerful synthesis which with variousmodifications influenced most of the great philosophers down to and including hegel but notonly philosophers were influenced by plato why did the puritans object to the music and paintingand gorgeous ritual of the catholic church you will find the answer in the tenth book of the republic why are children in school compelled to learn arithmetic the reasons are given in theseventh book the following paragraphs summarize platos theory of ideas our question is what is a philosopher the first answer is in accordance with the etymology aphilosopher is a lover of wisdom but this is not the same thing as a lover of knowledge in thesense in which an inquisitive man may be said to love knowledge vulgar curiosity does not makea philosopher the definition is therefore amended the philosopher is a man who loves thevision of truth but what is this vision consider a man who loves beautiful things who makes a point of being present at new tragediesseeing new pictures and hearing new music such a man is not a philosopher because he lovesonly beautiful things whereas the philosopher loves beauty in itself the man who only lovesbeautiful things is dreaming whereas the man who knows absolute beauty is wide awake theformer has only opinion the latter has knowledge what is the difference between knowledge and opinion the man who has knowledge hasknowledge of something that is to say of something that exists for what does not exist isnothing thus knowledge is infallible since it is logicallyimpossible for it to be mistaken but opinion can be mistaken how can this be opinion cannotbe of what is not for that is impossible nor of what is for then it would be knowledge thereforeopinion must be of what both is and is not but how is this possible the answer is that particular things always partake of oppositecharacters what is beautiful is also in some respects ugly what is just is in some respectsunjust and so on all particular sensible objects so plato contends have this contradictorycharacter they are thus intermediate between being and notbeing and are suitable as objects ofopinion but not of knowledge but those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may besaid to know and not to have opinion only thus we arrive at the conclusion that opinion is of the world presented to the senses whereasknowledge is of a supersensible eternal world for instance opinion is concerned with particularbeautiful things but knowledge is concerned with beauty in itself the only argument advanced is that it is selfcontradictory to suppose that a thing can be bothbeautiful and not beautiful or both just and not just and that nevertheless particular things seemto combine such contradictory characters therefore particular things are not real heraclitus hadsaid we step and do not step into the same rivers we are and are not by combining this with parmenides we arrive at platos result there is however something of great importance in platos doctrine which is not traceable to hispredecessors and that is the theory of ideas or forms this theory is partly logical partlymetaphysical the logical part has to do with the meaning of general words there are manyindividual animals of whom we can truly say this is a cat what do we mean by the word catobviously something different from each particular cat an animal is a cat it would seembecause it participates in a general nature common to all cats language cannot get on withoutgeneral words such as cat and such words are evidently not meaningless but if the word catmeans anything it means something which is not this or that cat but some kind of universalcattyness this is not born when a particular cat is born and does not die when it dies in fact ithas no position in space or time it is eternal this is the logical part of the doctrine thearguments in its favour whether ultimately valid or not are strong and quite independent of themetaphysical part of the doctrine according to the metaphysical part of the doctrine the word cat means a certain ideal cat thecat created by god and unique particular cats partake of the nature of the cat but more or lessim 
part i the pre socratics chapter i the rise of greek civilization in all history nothing is so surprising or so difficult to account for as the sudden rise ofcivilization in greece much of what makes civilization had already existed for thousands ofyears in egypt and in mesopotamia and had spread thence to neighbouring countries butcertain elements had been lacking until the greeks supplied them what they achieved in artand literature is familiar to everybody but what they did in the purely intellectual realm is evenmore exceptional they invented mathematics and science and philosophy they first wrotehistory as opposed to mere annals they speculated freely about the nature of the world and theends of life without being bound in the fetters of any inherited orthodoxy what occurred wasso astonishing that until very recent times men were content to gape and talk mystically aboutthe greek genius it is possible however to understand the development of greece in scientificterms and it is well worth while to do so philosophy begins with thales who fortunately can be dated by the fact that he predicted aneclipse which according to the astronomers occurred in the year bc philosophy andsciencewhich were not originally separatewere therefore born together at the beginning ofthe sixth century what had been happening in greece and neighbouring countries before thistime any answer must be in  arithmetic and some geometry existed among the egyptians and babylonians but mainlyin the form of rules of thumb deductive reasoning from general premisses was a greekinnovation part conjectural but archeology during the present century has given us much more knowledgethan was possessed by our grandfathers the art of writing was invented in egypt about the year bc and in babylonia not muchlater in each country writing began with pictures of the objects intended these pictures quicklybecame conventionalized so that words were represented by ideograms as they still are in china in the course of thousands of years this cumbrous system developed into alphabetic writing the early development of civilization in egypt and mesopotamia was due to the nile the tigrisand the euphrates which made agriculture very easy and very productive the civilization was inmany ways similar to that which the spaniards found in mexico and peru there was a divineking with despotic powers in egypt he owned all the land there was a polytheistic religionwith a supreme god to whom the king had a specially intimate relation there was a militaryaristocracy and also a priestly aristocracy the latter was often able to encroach on the royalpower if the king was weak or if he was engaged in a difficult war the cultivators of the soilwere serfs belonging to the king the aristocracy or the priesthood there was a considerable difference between egyptian and babylonian theology the egyptianswere preoccupied with death and believed that the souls of the dead descend into the underworldwhere they are judged by osiris according to the manner of their life on earth they thought thatthe soul would ultimately return to the body this led to mummification and to the construction ofsplendid tombs the pyramids were built by various kings at the end of the fourth millennium bc and the beginning of the third after this time egyptian civilization became more and morestereotyped and religious conservatism made progress impossible about bc egypt wasconquered by sernites named hyksos who ruled the country for about two centuries they left nopermanent mark on egypt but their presence there must have helped to spread egyptiancivilization in syria and palestine babylonia had a more warlike development than egypt at first the ruling race were not semitesbut sumerians whose origin is unknown they invented cuneiform writing which theconquering semites took over from them there was a period when there were variousindependent cities which fought with each other but in the 
but how is this possible the answer is that particular things always partake of oppositecharacters what is beautiful is also in some respects ugly what is just is in some respectsunjust and so on all particular sensible objects so plato contends have this contradictorycharacter they are thus intermediate between being and notbeing and are suitable as objects ofopinion but not of knowledge but those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may besaid to know and not to have opinion only thus we arrive at the conclusion that opinion is of the world presented to the senses whereasknowledge is of a supersensible eternal world for instance opinion is concerned with particularbeautiful things but knowledge is concerned with beauty in itself the only argument advanced is that it is selfcontradictory to suppose that a thing can be bothbeautiful and not beautiful or both just and not just and that nevertheless particular things seemto combine such contradictory characters therefore particular things are not real heraclitus hadsaid we step and do not step into the same rivers we are and are not by combining this with parmenides we arrive at platos result there is however something of great importance in platos doctrine which is not traceable to hispredecessors and that is the theory of ideas or forms this theory is partly logical partlymetaphysical the logical part has to do with the meaning of general words there are manyindividual animals of whom we can truly say this is a cat what do we mean by the word catobviously something different from each particular cat an animal is a cat it would seembecause it participates in a general nature common to all cats language cannot get on withoutgeneral words such as cat and such words are evidently not meaningless but if the word catmeans anything it means something which is not this or that cat but some kind of universalcattyness this is not born when a particular cat is born and does not die when it dies in fact ithas no position in space or time it is eternal this is the logical part of the doctrine thearguments in its favour whether ultimately valid or not are strong and quite independent of themetaphysical part of the doctrine according to the metaphysical part of the doctrine the word cat means a certain ideal cat thecat created by god and unique particular cats partake of the nature of the cat but more or lessim perfectly it is only owing to this imperfection that there can be many of them the cat is realparticular cats are only apparent in the last book of the republic as a preliminary to a condemnation of painters there is a veryclear exposition of the doctrine of ideas or forms here plato explains that whenever a number of individuals have a common name they have alsoa common idea or form for instance though there are many beds there is only one idea orform of a bed just as a reflection of a bed in a mirror is only apparent and not real so thevarious particular beds are unreal being only copies of the idea which is the one real bed and ismade by god of this one bed made by god there can be knowledge but in respect of the manybeds made by carpenters there can be only opinion the philosopher as such will be interestedonly in the one ideal bed not in the many beds found in the sensible world he will have a certainindifference to ordinary mundane affairs how can he who has magnificence of mind and is thespectator of all time and all existence think much of human life the youth who is capable ofbecoming a philosopher will be distinguished among his fellows as just and gentle fond oflearning possessed of a good memory and a naturally harmonious mind such a one shall beeducated into a philosopher and a guardian at this point adeimantus breaks in with a protest when he tries to argue with socrates he sayshe feels himself led a little astray at each step until in the end all his former notions are turnedupside down but whatever socrates may say it remains the case as any one can see that peoplewho stick to philosophy become strange monsters not to say utter rogues even the best of themare made useless by philosophy socrates admits that this is true in the world as it is but maintains that it is the other people whoare to blame not the philosophers in a wise community the philosophers would not seem foolishit is only among fools that the wise are judged to be destitute of wisdom what are we to do in this dilemma there were to have been two ways of inaugurating our republic by philosophers becoming rulers or by rulers becoming philosophers the first wayseems impossible as a beginning because in a city not already philosophic the philosophers areunpopular but a born prince might be a philosopher 
perfectly it is only owing to this imperfection that there can be many of them the cat is realparticular cats are only apparent in the last book of the republic as a preliminary to a condemnation of painters there is a veryclear exposition of the doctrine of ideas or forms here plato explains that whenever a number of individuals have a common name they have alsoa common idea or form for instance though there are many beds there is only one idea orform of a bed just as a reflection of a bed in a mirror is only apparent and not real so thevarious particular beds are unreal being only copies of the idea which is the one real bed and ismade by god of this one bed made by god there can be knowledge but in respect of the manybeds made by carpenters there can be only opinion the philosopher as such will be interestedonly in the one ideal bed not in the many beds found in the sensible world he will have a certainindifference to ordinary mundane affairs how can he who has magnificence of mind and is thespectator of all time and all existence think much of human life the youth who is capable ofbecoming a philosopher will be distinguished among his fellows as just and gentle fond oflearning possessed of a good memory and a naturally harmonious mind such a one shall beeducated into a philosopher and a guardian at this point adeimantus breaks in with a protest when he tries to argue with socrates he sayshe feels himself led a little astray at each step until in the end all his former notions are turnedupside down but whatever socrates may say it remains the case as any one can see that peoplewho stick to philosophy become strange monsters not to say utter rogues even the best of themare made useless by philosophy socrates admits that this is true in the world as it is but maintains that it is the other people whoare to blame not the philosophers in a wise community the philosophers would not seem foolishit is only among fools that the wise are judged to be destitute of wisdom what are we to do in this dilemma there were to have been two ways of inaugurating our republic by philosophers becoming rulers or by rulers becoming philosophers the first wayseems impossible as a beginning because in a city not already philosophic the philosophers areunpopular but a born prince might be a philosopher and one is enough let there be one man who has a city obedient to his will and he might bringinto existence the ideal polity about which the world is so incredulous plato hoped that he hadfound such a prince in the younger dionysius tyrant of syracuse but the young man turned outdisappointingly in the sixth and seventh books of the republic plato is concerned with two questions first whatis philosophy second how can a young man or woman of suitable temperament be so educatedas to become a philosopher philosophy for plato is a kind of vision the vision of truth it is not purely intellectual it is notmerely wisdom but love of wisdom spinozas intellectual love of god is much the sameintimate union of thought and feeling every one who has done any kind of creative work hasexperienced in a greater or less degree the state of mind in which after long labour truth orbeauty appears or seems to appear in a sudden gloryit may be only about some small matter orit may be about the universe the experience is at the moment very convincing doubt may comelater but at the time there is utter certainty i think most of the best creative work in art inscience in literature and in philosophy has been the result of such a moment whether it comesto others as to me i cannot say for my part i have found that when i wish to write a book onsome subject i must first soak myself in detail until all the separate parts of the subjectmatter arefamiliar then some day if i am fortunate i perceive the whole with all its parts duly interrelated after that i only have to write down what i have seen the nearest analogy is first walking allover a mountain in a mist until every path and ridge and valley is separately familiar and thenfrom a distance seeing the mountain whole and clear in bright sunshine this experience i believe is necessary to good creative work but it is not sufficient indeed thesubjective certainty that it brings with it may be fatally misleading william james describes aman who got the experience from laughinggas whenever he was under its influence he knew thesecret of the universe but when he came to he had forgotten it at last with immense effort hewrote down the secret before the vision had faded when completely recovered he rushed to seewhat he had written it was a smell of petroleum prevails throughout what seems like suddeninsight may be mis 
and one is enough let there be one man who has a city obedient to his will and he might bringinto existence the ideal polity about which the world is so incredulous plato hoped that he hadfound such a prince in the younger dionysius tyrant of syracuse but the young man turned outdisappointingly in the sixth and seventh books of the republic plato is concerned with two questions first whatis philosophy second how can a young man or woman of suitable temperament be so educatedas to become a philosopher philosophy for plato is a kind of vision the vision of truth it is not purely intellectual it is notmerely wisdom but love of wisdom spinozas intellectual love of god is much the sameintimate union of thought and feeling every one who has done any kind of creative work hasexperienced in a greater or less degree the state of mind in which after long labour truth orbeauty appears or seems to appear in a sudden gloryit may be only about some small matter orit may be about the universe the experience is at the moment very convincing doubt may comelater but at the time there is utter certainty i think most of the best creative work in art inscience in literature and in philosophy has been the result of such a moment whether it comesto others as to me i cannot say for my part i have found that when i wish to write a book onsome subject i must first soak myself in detail until all the separate parts of the subjectmatter arefamiliar then some day if i am fortunate i perceive the whole with all its parts duly interrelated after that i only have to write down what i have seen the nearest analogy is first walking allover a mountain in a mist until every path and ridge and valley is separately familiar and thenfrom a distance seeing the mountain whole and clear in bright sunshine this experience i believe is necessary to good creative work but it is not sufficient indeed thesubjective certainty that it brings with it may be fatally misleading william james describes aman who got the experience from laughinggas whenever he was under its influence he knew thesecret of the universe but when he came to he had forgotten it at last with immense effort hewrote down the secret before the vision had faded when completely recovered he rushed to seewhat he had written it was a smell of petroleum prevails throughout what seems like suddeninsight may be mis leading and must be tested soberly when the divine intoxication has passed platos vision which he completely trusted at the time when he wrote the republic needsultimately the help of a parable the parable of the cave in order to convey its nature to the reader but it is led up to by various preliminary discussions designed to make the reader see thenecessity of the world of ideas first the world of the intellect is distinguished from the world of the senses then intellect andsenseperception are in turn each divided into two kinds the two kinds of senseperception neednot concern us the two kinds of intellect are called respectively reason and understandingof these reason is the higher kind it is concerned with pure ideas and its method is dialectic understanding is the kind of intellect that is used in mathematics it is inferior to reason in that ituses hypotheses which it cannot test in geometry for example we say let abc be a rectilineartriangle it is against the rules to ask whether abc really is a rectilinear triangle although if it isa figure that we have drawn we may be sure that it is not because we cannot draw absolutelystraight lines accordingly mathematics can never tell us what is but only what would be if  there are no straight lines in the sensible world therefore if mathematics is to have more thanhypothetical truth we must find evidence for the existence of supersensible straight lines in asupersensible world this cannot be done by the understanding but according to plato it can bedone by reason which shows that there is a rectilinear triangle in heaven of which geometricalpropositions can be affirmed categorically not hypothetically there is at this point a difficulty which seems to have escaped platos notice although it wasevident to modern idealistic philosophers we saw that god made only one bed and it would benatural to suppose that he made only one straight line but if there is a heavenly triangle he musthave made at least three straight lines the objects of geometry though ideal must exist in manyexamples we need the possibility of two intersecting circles and so on this suggests thatgeometry on platos theory should not be capable of ultimate truth but should be condemned aspart of the study of appearance we will however ignore this point plato seeks to explain the difference between clear intellectual 
leading and must be tested soberly when the divine intoxication has passed platos vision which he completely trusted at the time when he wrote the republic needsultimately the help of a parable the parable of the cave in order to convey its nature to the reader but it is led up to by various preliminary discussions designed to make the reader see thenecessity of the world of ideas first the world of the intellect is distinguished from the world of the senses then intellect andsenseperception are in turn each divided into two kinds the two kinds of senseperception neednot concern us the two kinds of intellect are called respectively reason and understandingof these reason is the higher kind it is concerned with pure ideas and its method is dialectic understanding is the kind of intellect that is used in mathematics it is inferior to reason in that ituses hypotheses which it cannot test in geometry for example we say let abc be a rectilineartriangle it is against the rules to ask whether abc really is a rectilinear triangle although if it isa figure that we have drawn we may be sure that it is not because we cannot draw absolutelystraight lines accordingly mathematics can never tell us what is but only what would be if  there are no straight lines in the sensible world therefore if mathematics is to have more thanhypothetical truth we must find evidence for the existence of supersensible straight lines in asupersensible world this cannot be done by the understanding but according to plato it can bedone by reason which shows that there is a rectilinear triangle in heaven of which geometricalpropositions can be affirmed categorically not hypothetically there is at this point a difficulty which seems to have escaped platos notice although it wasevident to modern idealistic philosophers we saw that god made only one bed and it would benatural to suppose that he made only one straight line but if there is a heavenly triangle he musthave made at least three straight lines the objects of geometry though ideal must exist in manyexamples we need the possibility of two intersecting circles and so on this suggests thatgeometry on platos theory should not be capable of ultimate truth but should be condemned aspart of the study of appearance we will however ignore this point plato seeks to explain the difference between clear intellectual vision and the confused vision of senseperception by an analogy from the sense of sight sight hesays differs from the other senses since it requires not only the eye and the object but also light we see clearly objects on which the sun shines in twilight we see confusedly and in pitchdarkness not at all now the world of ideas is what we see when the object is illumined by the sunwhile the world of passing things is a confused twilight world the eye is compared to the souland the sun as the source of light to truth or goodness the soul is like an eye when resting upon that on which truth and being shine the soul perceivesand understands and is radiant with intelligence but when turned towards the twilight ofbecoming and perishing then she has opinion only and goes blinking about and is first of oneopinion and then of another and seems to have no intelligence  now what imparts truth to theknown and the power of knowing to the knower is what i would have you term the idea of goodand this you will deem to be the cause of science this leads up to the famous simile of the cave or den according to which those who are destituteof philosophy may be compared to prisoners in a cave who are only able to look in one directionbecause they are bound and who have a fire behind them and a wall in front between them andthe wall there is nothing all that they see are shadows of themselves and of objects behind themcast on the wall by the light of the fire inevitably they regard these shadows as real and have nonotion of the objects to which they are due at last some man succeeds in escaping from the caveto the light of the sun for the first time he sees real things and becomes aware that he had hithertobeen deceived by shadows if he is the sort of philosopher who is fit to become a guardian he willfeel it his duty to those who were formerly his fellowprisoners to go down again into the caveinstruct them as to the truth and show them the way up but he will have difficulty in persuadingthem because coming out of the sunlight he will see shadows less clearly than they do and willseem to them stupider than before his escape and now i said let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened behold human beings living in an underground den which has a mouth open toward the light andreaching all along the den here they have been from their child 
vision and the confused vision of senseperception by an analogy from the sense of sight sight hesays differs from the other senses since it requires not only the eye and the object but also light we see clearly objects on which the sun shines in twilight we see confusedly and in pitchdarkness not at all now the world of ideas is what we see when the object is illumined by the sunwhile the world of passing things is a confused twilight world the eye is compared to the souland the sun as the source of light to truth or goodness the soul is like an eye when resting upon that on which truth and being shine the soul perceivesand understands and is radiant with intelligence but when turned towards the twilight ofbecoming and perishing then she has opinion only and goes blinking about and is first of oneopinion and then of another and seems to have no intelligence  now what imparts truth to theknown and the power of knowing to the knower is what i would have you term the idea of goodand this you will deem to be the cause of science this leads up to the famous simile of the cave or den according to which those who are destituteof philosophy may be compared to prisoners in a cave who are only able to look in one directionbecause they are bound and who have a fire behind them and a wall in front between them andthe wall there is nothing all that they see are shadows of themselves and of objects behind themcast on the wall by the light of the fire inevitably they regard these shadows as real and have nonotion of the objects to which they are due at last some man succeeds in escaping from the caveto the light of the sun for the first time he sees real things and becomes aware that he had hithertobeen deceived by shadows if he is the sort of philosopher who is fit to become a guardian he willfeel it his duty to those who were formerly his fellowprisoners to go down again into the caveinstruct them as to the truth and show them the way up but he will have difficulty in persuadingthem because coming out of the sunlight he will see shadows less clearly than they do and willseem to them stupider than before his escape and now i said let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened behold human beings living in an underground den which has a mouth open toward the light andreaching all along the den here they have been from their child hood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see beforethem being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads above and behind them a fireis blazing at a distance and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way and you willsee if you look a low wall built along the way like the screen which marionette players have infront of them over which they show the puppets i see and do you see i said men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels and statues andfigures of animals made of wood and stone and various materials which appear over the wall some of them are talking others silent you have shown me a strange image and they are strange prisoners like ourselves i replied and they see only their own shadows or the shadows of one anotherwhich the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave the position of the good in platos philosophy is peculiar science and truth he says are like thegood but the good has a higher place the good is not essence but far exceeds essence in dignityand power dialectic leads to the end of the intellectual world in the perception of the absolutegood it is by means of the good that dialectic is able to dispense with the hypotheses of themathematician the underlying assumption is that reality as opposed to appearance is completelyand perfectly good to perceive the good therefore is to perceive reality throughout platosphilosophy there is the same fusion of intellect and mysticism as in pythagoreanism but at thisfinal culmination mysticism clearly has the upper hand platos doctrine of ideas contains a number of obvious errors but in spite of these it marks a veryimportant advance in philosophy since it is the first theory to emphasise the problem ofuniversals which in varying forms has persisted to the present day beginnings are apt to becrude but their originality should not be overlooked on this account something remains of what plato had to say even after all necessary corrections have been made the absolute minimum ofwhat remains even in the view of those most hostile to plato is this that we cannot expressourselves in a language composed wholly of proper names but must have also general words suchas man 
hood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see beforethem being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads above and behind them a fireis blazing at a distance and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way and you willsee if you look a low wall built along the way like the screen which marionette players have infront of them over which they show the puppets i see and do you see i said men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels and statues andfigures of animals made of wood and stone and various materials which appear over the wall some of them are talking others silent you have shown me a strange image and they are strange prisoners like ourselves i replied and they see only their own shadows or the shadows of one anotherwhich the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave the position of the good in platos philosophy is peculiar science and truth he says are like thegood but the good has a higher place the good is not essence but far exceeds essence in dignityand power dialectic leads to the end of the intellectual world in the perception of the absolutegood it is by means of the good that dialectic is able to dispense with the hypotheses of themathematician the underlying assumption is that reality as opposed to appearance is completelyand perfectly good to perceive the good therefore is to perceive reality throughout platosphilosophy there is the same fusion of intellect and mysticism as in pythagoreanism but at thisfinal culmination mysticism clearly has the upper hand platos doctrine of ideas contains a number of obvious errors but in spite of these it marks a veryimportant advance in philosophy since it is the first theory to emphasise the problem ofuniversals which in varying forms has persisted to the present day beginnings are apt to becrude but their originality should not be overlooked on this account something remains of what plato had to say even after all necessary corrections have been made the absolute minimum ofwhat remains even in the view of those most hostile to plato is this that we cannot expressourselves in a language composed wholly of proper names but must have also general words suchas man dog cat or if not these then relational words such as similar before and so on suchwords are not meaningless noises and it is difficult to see how they can have meaning if the worldconsists entirely of particular things such as are designated by proper names there may be waysof getting round this argument but at any rate it affords a prima facie case in favour of universals i shall provisionally accept it as in some degree valid but when so much is granted the rest ofwhat plato says by no means follows in the first place plato has no understanding of philosophical syntax i can say socrates ishuman plato is human and so on in all these statements it may be assumed that the wordhuman has exactly the same meaning but whatever it means it means something which is notof the same kind as socrates plato and the rest of the individuals who compose the human racehuman is an adjective it would be nonsense to say human is human plato makes a mistakeanalogous to saying human is human he thinks that beauty is beautiful he thinks that theuniversal man is the name of a pattern man created by god of whom actual men are imperfectand somewhat unreal copies he fails altogether to realize how great is the gap between universalsand particulars his ideas are really just other particulars ethically and aesthetically superior tothe ordinary kind he himself at a later date began to see this difficulty as appears in the parmenides which contains one of the most remarkable cases in history of selfcriticism by aphilosopher the parmenides is supposed to be related by antiphon who aloneremembers the conversation but is now only interested in horses they find him carrying a bridleand with difficulty persuade him to relate the famous discussion between parmenides zeno and socrates this we are told took place when parmenides was old zeno inmiddle life and socrates quite a young man socrates expounds the theory of ideashe is sure that there are ideas of likeness justice beauty and goodness he is not sure that there isan idea of man and he rejects with indignation the suggestion that there could be ideas of suchthings as hair and mud and dirtthough he adds there are times when he thinks that there isnothing without an idea he runs away from this view because he is afraid of falling into abottomless pit of nonsense 
dog cat or if not these then relational words such as similar before and so on suchwords are not meaningless noises and it is difficult to see how they can have meaning if the worldconsists entirely of particular things such as are designated by proper names there may be waysof getting round this argument but at any rate it affords a prima facie case in favour of universals i shall provisionally accept it as in some degree valid but when so much is granted the rest ofwhat plato says by no means follows in the first place plato has no understanding of philosophical syntax i can say socrates ishuman plato is human and so on in all these statements it may be assumed that the wordhuman has exactly the same meaning but whatever it means it means something which is notof the same kind as socrates plato and the rest of the individuals who compose the human racehuman is an adjective it would be nonsense to say human is human plato makes a mistakeanalogous to saying human is human he thinks that beauty is beautiful he thinks that theuniversal man is the name of a pattern man created by god of whom actual men are imperfectand somewhat unreal copies he fails altogether to realize how great is the gap between universalsand particulars his ideas are really just other particulars ethically and aesthetically superior tothe ordinary kind he himself at a later date began to see this difficulty as appears in the parmenides which contains one of the most remarkable cases in history of selfcriticism by aphilosopher the parmenides is supposed to be related by antiphon who aloneremembers the conversation but is now only interested in horses they find him carrying a bridleand with difficulty persuade him to relate the famous discussion between parmenides zeno and socrates this we are told took place when parmenides was old zeno inmiddle life and socrates quite a young man socrates expounds the theory of ideashe is sure that there are ideas of likeness justice beauty and goodness he is not sure that there isan idea of man and he rejects with indignation the suggestion that there could be ideas of suchthings as hair and mud and dirtthough he adds there are times when he thinks that there isnothing without an idea he runs away from this view because he is afraid of falling into abottomless pit of nonsense yes socrates said parmenides that is because you are still young the time will come if i amnot mistaken when philosophy will have a firmer grasp of you and then you will not despise eventhe meanest things socrates agrees that in his view there are certain ideas of which all other things partake andfrom which they derive their names that similars for example become similar because theypartake of similarity and great things become great because they partake of greatness and thatjust and beautiful things become just and beautiful because they partake of justice and beauty parmenides proceeds to raise difficulties does the individual partake of the whole idea oronly of a part to either view there are objections if the former one thing is in many places atonce if the latter the idea is divisible and a thing which has a part of smallness will be smallerthan absolute smallness which is absurd when an individual partakes of an idea theindividual and the idea are similar therefore there will have to be another idea embracing boththe particulars and the original idea and there will have to be yet another embracing theparticulars and the two ideas and so on ad infinitum thus every idea instead of being onebecomes an infinite series of ideas socrates suggests that perhaps ideas are only thoughts but parmenides points out that thoughtsmust be of something ideas cannot resemble the particulars that partake of them for thereason given in above ideas if there are any must be unknown to us because ourknowledge is not absolute if gods knowledge is absolute he will not know us and thereforecannot rule us nevertheless the theory of ideas is not wholly abandoned without ideas socrates says there willbe nothing on which the mind can rest and therefore reasoning will be destroyed parmenides tellshim that his troubles come of lack of previous training but no definite conclusion is reached i do not think that platos logical objections to the reality of sensible particulars will bearexamination he says for example that whatever is beautiful is also in some respect ugly what isdouble is also half and so on but when we say of some work of art that it is beautiful in somerespects and ugly in others analysis will always at least 
yes socrates said parmenides that is because you are still young the time will come if i amnot mistaken when philosophy will have a firmer grasp of you and then you will not despise eventhe meanest things socrates agrees that in his view there are certain ideas of which all other things partake andfrom which they derive their names that similars for example become similar because theypartake of similarity and great things become great because they partake of greatness and thatjust and beautiful things become just and beautiful because they partake of justice and beauty parmenides proceeds to raise difficulties does the individual partake of the whole idea oronly of a part to either view there are objections if the former one thing is in many places atonce if the latter the idea is divisible and a thing which has a part of smallness will be smallerthan absolute smallness which is absurd when an individual partakes of an idea theindividual and the idea are similar therefore there will have to be another idea embracing boththe particulars and the original idea and there will have to be yet another embracing theparticulars and the two ideas and so on ad infinitum thus every idea instead of being onebecomes an infinite series of ideas socrates suggests that perhaps ideas are only thoughts but parmenides points out that thoughtsmust be of something ideas cannot resemble the particulars that partake of them for thereason given in above ideas if there are any must be unknown to us because ourknowledge is not absolute if gods knowledge is absolute he will not know us and thereforecannot rule us nevertheless the theory of ideas is not wholly abandoned without ideas socrates says there willbe nothing on which the mind can rest and therefore reasoning will be destroyed parmenides tellshim that his troubles come of lack of previous training but no definite conclusion is reached i do not think that platos logical objections to the reality of sensible particulars will bearexamination he says for example that whatever is beautiful is also in some respect ugly what isdouble is also half and so on but when we say of some work of art that it is beautiful in somerespects and ugly in others analysis will always enable us to say this part or aspect is beautiful while that part or aspect is uglyand as regards double and half these are relative terms there is no contradiction in the factthat is double of and half of plato is perpetually getting into trouble through notunderstanding relative terms he thinks that if a is greater than b and less than c then a is atonce great and small which seems to him a contradiction such troubles are among the infantilediseases of philosophy the distinction between reality and appearance cannot have the consequences attributed to it by parmenides and plato and hegel if appearance really appears it is not nothing and is thereforepart of reality this is an argument of the correct parmenidean sort if appearance does not reallyappear why trouble our heads about it but perhaps some one will say appearance does notreally appear but it appears to appear this will not help for we shall ask again does it reallyappear to appear or only apparently appear to appear sooner or later if appearance is even toappear to appear we must reach something that really appears and is therefore part of reality plato would not dream of denying that there appear to be many beds although there is only onereal bed namely the one made by god but he does not seem to have faced the implications of thefact that there are many appearances and that this manyness is part of reality any attempt todivide the world into portions of which one is more real than the other is doomed to failure connected with this is another curious view of platos that knowledge and opinion must beconcerned with different subjectmatters we should say if i think it is going to snow that isopinion if later i see it snowing that is knowledge but the subjectmatter is the same on bothoccasions plato however thinks that what can at any time be a matter of opinion can never be amatter of knowledge knowledge is certain and infallible opinion is not merely fallible but isnecessarily mistaken since it assumes the reality of what is only appearance all this repeats whathad been said by parmenides there is one respect in which platos metaphysic is apparently different from that of parmenides for parmenides there is only the one for plate there are many ideas there are not only beautytruth and goodness but as we saw there is the heavenly bed created by god there is a heavenlyman a heavenly dog a heavenly cat and 
theoretically enable us to say this part or aspect is beautiful while that part or aspect is uglyand as regards double and half these are relative terms there is no contradiction in the factthat is double of and half of plato is perpetually getting into trouble through notunderstanding relative terms he thinks that if a is greater than b and less than c then a is atonce great and small which seems to him a contradiction such troubles are among the infantilediseases of philosophy the distinction between reality and appearance cannot have the consequences attributed to it by parmenides and plato and hegel if appearance really appears it is not nothing and is thereforepart of reality this is an argument of the correct parmenidean sort if appearance does not reallyappear why trouble our heads about it but perhaps some one will say appearance does notreally appear but it appears to appear this will not help for we shall ask again does it reallyappear to appear or only apparently appear to appear sooner or later if appearance is even toappear to appear we must reach something that really appears and is therefore part of reality plato would not dream of denying that there appear to be many beds although there is only onereal bed namely the one made by god but he does not seem to have faced the implications of thefact that there are many appearances and that this manyness is part of reality any attempt todivide the world into portions of which one is more real than the other is doomed to failure connected with this is another curious view of platos that knowledge and opinion must beconcerned with different subjectmatters we should say if i think it is going to snow that isopinion if later i see it snowing that is knowledge but the subjectmatter is the same on bothoccasions plato however thinks that what can at any time be a matter of opinion can never be amatter of knowledge knowledge is certain and infallible opinion is not merely fallible but isnecessarily mistaken since it assumes the reality of what is only appearance all this repeats whathad been said by parmenides there is one respect in which platos metaphysic is apparently different from that of parmenides for parmenides there is only the one for plate there are many ideas there are not only beautytruth and goodness but as we saw there is the heavenly bed created by god there is a heavenlyman a heavenly dog a heavenly cat and so on through a whole noahs ark all this however seems in the republic to have been notadequately thought out a platonic idea or form is not a thought though it may be the object of athought it is difficult to see how god can have created it since its being is timeless and he couldnot have decided to create a bed unless his thought when he decided had had for its object thatvery platonic bed which we are told he brought into existence what is timeless must beuncreated we come here to a difficulty which has troubled many philosophic theologians onlythe contingent world the world in space and time can have been created but this is the everydayworld which has been condemned as illusory and also bad therefore the creator it would seemcreated only illusion and evil some gnostics were so consistent as to adopt this view but in platothe difficulty is still below the surface and he seems in the republic to have never become awareof it the philosopher who is to be a guardian must according to plato return into the cave and liveamong those who have never seen the sun of truth it would seem that god himself if he wishesto amend his creation must do likewise a christian platonist might so interpret the incarnation but it remains completely impossible to explain why god was not content with the world of ideas the philosopher finds the cave in existence and is actuated by benevolence in returning to it butthe creator if he created everything might one would think have avoided the cave altogether perhaps this difficulty arises only from the christian notion of a creator and is not chargeable to plato who says that god did not create everything but only what is good the multiplicity of thesensible world on this view would have some other source than god and the ideas wouldperhaps be not so much created by god as constituents of his essence the apparent pluralisminvolved in the multiplicity of ideas would thus not be ultimate ultimately there is only god orthe good to whom the ideas are adjectival this at any rate is a possible interpretation of plato plato proceeds to an interesting sketch of the education proper to a young man who is to be aguardian we saw that the young man is selected for this honour on the ground of a combinationof intellectual and moral qualities he must be just and gentle fond of learning with a goodmemory and a harmonious mind the young man 
so on through a whole noahs ark all this however seems in the republic to have been notadequately thought out a platonic idea or form is not a thought though it may be the object of athought it is difficult to see how god can have created it since its being is timeless and he couldnot have decided to create a bed unless his thought when he decided had had for its object thatvery platonic bed which we are told he brought into existence what is timeless must beuncreated we come here to a difficulty which has troubled many philosophic theologians onlythe contingent world the world in space and time can have been created but this is the everydayworld which has been condemned as illusory and also bad therefore the creator it would seemcreated only illusion and evil some gnostics were so consistent as to adopt this view but in platothe difficulty is still below the surface and he seems in the republic to have never become awareof it the philosopher who is to be a guardian must according to plato return into the cave and liveamong those who have never seen the sun of truth it would seem that god himself if he wishesto amend his creation must do likewise a christian platonist might so interpret the incarnation but it remains completely impossible to explain why god was not content with the world of ideas the philosopher finds the cave in existence and is actuated by benevolence in returning to it butthe creator if he created everything might one would think have avoided the cave altogether perhaps this difficulty arises only from the christian notion of a creator and is not chargeable to plato who says that god did not create everything but only what is good the multiplicity of thesensible world on this view would have some other source than god and the ideas wouldperhaps be not so much created by god as constituents of his essence the apparent pluralisminvolved in the multiplicity of ideas would thus not be ultimate ultimately there is only god orthe good to whom the ideas are adjectival this at any rate is a possible interpretation of plato plato proceeds to an interesting sketch of the education proper to a young man who is to be aguardian we saw that the young man is selected for this honour on the ground of a combinationof intellectual and moral qualities he must be just and gentle fond of learning with a goodmemory and a harmonious mind the young man who has been chosen for these merits will spend the years from twenty to thirty on the four pythagorean studies arithmetic geometry astronomy and harmony thesestudies are not to be pursued in any utilitarian spirit but in order to prepare his mind for the visionof eternal things in astronomy for example he is not to trouble himself too much about the actualheavenly bodies but rather with the mathematics of the motion of ideal heavenly bodies this maysound absurd to modern ears but strange to say it proved to be a fruitful point of view inconnection with empirical astronomy the way this came about is curious and worth considering the apparent motions of the planets until they have been very profoundly analysed appear to beirregular and complicated and not at all such as a pythagorean creator would have chosen it wasobvious to every greek that the heavens ought to exemplify mathematical beauty which wouldonly be the case if the planets moved in circles this would be especially evident to plato owingto his emphasis on the good the problem thus arose is there any hypothesis which will reducethe apparent disorderliness of planetary motions to order and beauty and simplicity if there is theidea of the good will justify us in asserting this hypothesis aristarchus of samos found such ahypothesis that all the planets including the earth go round the sun in circles this view wasrejected for two thousand years partly on the authority of aristotle who attributes a rather similarhypothesis to the pythagoreans it was revived by copernicus and its successmight seem to justify platos aesthetic bias in astronomy unfortunately however keplerdiscovered that the planets move in ellipses not in circles with the sun at a focus not at thecentre then newton discovered that they do not move even in exact ellipses and so thegeometrical simplicity sought by plato and apparently found by aristarchus of samos proved inthe end illusory this piece of scientific history illustrates a general maxim that any hypothesis however absurdmay be useful in science if it enables a discoverer to conceive things in a new way but that whenit has served this purpose by luck it is likely to become an obstacle to further advance the beliefin the good as the key to the scientific understanding of the world was useful at a certain stage inas

the body and while the soul is infected with the evils of the body our desire for truth will not besatisfied this point of view excludes scientific observation and experiment as methods for the attainmentof knowledge the experimenters mind is not gathered into itself and does not aim at avoidingsounds or sights the two kinds of mental activity that can be pursued by the method that platorecommends are mathematics and mystic insight this explains how these two come to be sointimately combined in plato and the pythagoreans to the empiricist the body is what brings us into touch with the world of external reality but to plato it is doubly evil as a distorting medium causing us to see as through a glass darkly and as asource of lusts which distract us from the pursuit of knowledge and the vision of truth somequotations will make this clear the body is the source of endless trouble to us by reason of the mere requirement of food and isliable also to diseases which overtake and impede us in the search after true being it fills us full ofloves and lusts and fears and fancies of all kinds and endless foolery and in fact as men saytakes away from us all power of thinking at all whence come wars and fightings and factions whence but from the body and the lusts of the body wars are occasioned by the love of moneyand money has to be acquired for the sake and in the service of the body and by reason of allthese impediments we have no time to give to philosophy and last and worst of all even if weare at leisure to betake ourselves to some speculation the body is always breaking in upon uscausing turmoil and confusion in our inquiries and so amazing us that we are prevented fromseeing the truth it has been proved to us by experience that if we would have true knowledge ofanything we must be quit of the bodythe soul in herself must behold things in themselves andthen we shall attain the wisdom which we desire and of which we say we are lovers not while welive but after death for if while in company with the body the soul cannot have pure knowledgeknowledge must be attained after death if at all and thus having got rid of the foolishness of the body we shall be pure and have converse withthe pure and know of ourselves the clear light everywhere which is no other than the light oftruth for the impure are not permitted to approach the pure  and what is purification but theseparation of the soul from the body  and this separation and release of the soul from the body is termed death  and thetrue philosophers and they only are ever seeking to release the soul there is one true coin for which all things ought to be exchanged and that is wisdom the founders of the mysteries would appear to have had a real meaning and were not talkingnonsense when they intimated in a figure long ago that he who passes unsanctified and uninitiatedinto the world below will lie in a slough but that he who arrives there after initiation andpurification will dwell with the gods for many as they say in the mysteries are the thyrsusbearers but few are the mystics meaning as i interpret the words the true philosophers all this language is mystical and is derived from the mysteries purity is an orphic conceptionhaving primarily a ritual meaning but for plato it means freedom from slavery to the body and itsneeds it is interesting to find him saying that wars are caused by love of money and that money isonly needed for the service of the body the first half of this opinion is the same as that held by marx but the second belongs to a very different outlook plato thinks that a man could live onvery little money if his wants were reduced to a minimum and this no doubt is true but he alsothinks that a philosopher should be exempt from manual labour he must therefore live on wealthcreated by others in a very poor state there are likely to be no philosophers it was theimperialism of athens in the age of pericles that made it possible for athenians to studyphilosophy speaking broadly intellectual goods are just as expensive as more materialcommodities and just as little independent of economic conditions science requires librarieslaboratories telescopes microscopes and so on and men of science have to be supported by thelabour of others but to the mystic all this is foolishness a holy man in india or tibet needs noapparatus wears only a loin cloth eats only rice and is supported by very meagre charity becausehe is thought wise this is the logical development of platos point of view to return to the phaedo cebes expresses doubt as to the survival of the soul after death andurges socrates to offer arguments this he proceeds to do but it must be said that the argumentsare very poor 
body  and this separation and release of the soul from the body is termed death  and thetrue philosophers and they only are ever seeking to release the soul there is one true coin for which all things ought to be exchanged and that is wisdom the founders of the mysteries would appear to have had a real meaning and were not talkingnonsense when they intimated in a figure long ago that he who passes unsanctified and uninitiatedinto the world below will lie in a slough but that he who arrives there after initiation andpurification will dwell with the gods for many as they say in the mysteries are the thyrsusbearers but few are the mystics meaning as i interpret the words the true philosophers all this language is mystical and is derived from the mysteries purity is an orphic conceptionhaving primarily a ritual meaning but for plato it means freedom from slavery to the body and itsneeds it is interesting to find him saying that wars are caused by love of money and that money isonly needed for the service of the body the first half of this opinion is the same as that held by marx but the second belongs to a very different outlook plato thinks that a man could live onvery little money if his wants were reduced to a minimum and this no doubt is true but he alsothinks that a philosopher should be exempt from manual labour he must therefore live on wealthcreated by others in a very poor state there are likely to be no philosophers it was theimperialism of athens in the age of pericles that made it possible for athenians to studyphilosophy speaking broadly intellectual goods are just as expensive as more materialcommodities and just as little independent of economic conditions science requires librarieslaboratories telescopes microscopes and so on and men of science have to be supported by thelabour of others but to the mystic all this is foolishness a holy man in india or tibet needs noapparatus wears only a loin cloth eats only rice and is supported by very meagre charity becausehe is thought wise this is the logical development of platos point of view to return to the phaedo cebes expresses doubt as to the survival of the soul after death andurges socrates to offer arguments this he proceeds to do but it must be said that the argumentsare very poor the first argument is that all things which have opposites are generated from their oppositesastatement which reminds us of anaximanders views on cosmic justice now life and death areopposites and therefore each must generate the other it follows that the souls of the dead existsomewhere and come back to earth in due course saint pauls statement the seed is notquickened except it die seems to belong to some such theory as this the second argument is that knowledge is recollection and therefore the soul must have existedbefore birth the theory that knowledge is recollection is supported chiefly by the fact that wehave ideas such as exact equality which cannot be derived from experience we have experienceof approximate equality but absolute equality is never found among sensible objects and yet weknow what we mean by absolute equality since we have not learnt this from experience wemust have brought the knowledge with us from a previous existence a similar argument he saysapplies to all other ideas thus the existence of essences and our capacity to apprehend themproves the preexistence of the soul with knowledge the contention that all knowledge is reminiscence is developed at greater length in the meno here socrates says there is no teaching but only recollection he professes to prove hispoint by having meno call in a slaveboy whom socrates proceeds to question on geometricalproblems the boys answers are supposed to show that he really knows geometry although he hashitherto been unaware of possessing this knowledge the same conclusion is drawn in the menoas in the phaedo that knowledge is brought by the soul from a previous existence as to this one may observe in the first place that the argument is wholly inapplicable toempirical knowledge the slaveboy could not have been led to remember when the pyramidswere built or whether the siege of troy really occurred unless he had happened to be present atthese events only the sort of knowledge that is called a prioriespecially logic and mathematicscan be possibly supposed to exist in every one independently of experience in fact this is the onlysort of knowledge that plato admits to be really knowledge let us seehow the argument can be met in regard to mathematics 
the first argument is that all things which have opposites are generated from their oppositesastatement which reminds us of anaximanders views on cosmic justice now life and death areopposites and therefore each must generate the other it follows that the souls of the dead existsomewhere and come back to earth in due course saint pauls statement the seed is notquickened except it die seems to belong to some such theory as this the second argument is that knowledge is recollection and therefore the soul must have existedbefore birth the theory that knowledge is recollection is supported chiefly by the fact that wehave ideas such as exact equality which cannot be derived from experience we have experienceof approximate equality but absolute equality is never found among sensible objects and yet weknow what we mean by absolute equality since we have not learnt this from experience wemust have brought the knowledge with us from a previous existence a similar argument he saysapplies to all other ideas thus the existence of essences and our capacity to apprehend themproves the preexistence of the soul with knowledge the contention that all knowledge is reminiscence is developed at greater length in the meno here socrates says there is no teaching but only recollection he professes to prove hispoint by having meno call in a slaveboy whom socrates proceeds to question on geometricalproblems the boys answers are supposed to show that he really knows geometry although he hashitherto been unaware of possessing this knowledge the same conclusion is drawn in the menoas in the phaedo that knowledge is brought by the soul from a previous existence as to this one may observe in the first place that the argument is wholly inapplicable toempirical knowledge the slaveboy could not have been led to remember when the pyramidswere built or whether the siege of troy really occurred unless he had happened to be present atthese events only the sort of knowledge that is called a prioriespecially logic and mathematicscan be possibly supposed to exist in every one independently of experience in fact this is the onlysort of knowledge that plato admits to be really knowledge let us seehow the argument can be met in regard to mathematics take the concept of equality we must admit that we have no experience among sensible objectsof exact equality we see only approximate equality how then do we arrive at the idea ofabsolute equality or do we perhaps have no such idea let us take a concrete case the metre is defined as the length of a certain rod in paris at a certaintemperature what should we mean if we said of some other rod that its length was exactly onemetre i dont think we should mean anything we could say the most accurare processes ofmeasurement known to science at the present day fail to show that our rod is either longer orshorter than the standard metre in paris we might if we were sufficiently rash add a prophecythat no subsequent refinements in the technique of measurement will alter this result but this isstill an empirical statement in the sense that empirical evidence may at any moment disprove it ido not think we really possess the idea of absolute equality that plato supposes us to possess but even if we do it is clear that no child possesses it until it reaches a certain age and that theidea is elicited by experience although not directly derived from experience moreover unless ourexistence before birth was not one of senseperception it would have been as incapable ofgenerating the idea as this life is and if our previous existence is supposed to have been partlysupersensible why not make the same supposition concerning our present existence on all thesegrounds the argument fails the doctrine of reminiscence being considered established cebes says about half of what wasrequired has been proven to wit that our souls existed before we were born that the soul willexist after death as well as before birth is the other half of which the proof is still wantingsocrates accordingly applies himself to this he says that it follows from what was said abouteverything being generated from its opposite according to which death must generate life just asmuch as life generates death but he adds another argument which had a longer history inphilosophy that only what is complex can be dissolved and that the soul like the ideas is simpleand not compounded of parts what is simple it is thought cannot begin or end or change nowessences are unchanging absolute beauty for example is always the same whereas beautifulthings continually 
take the concept of equality we must admit that we have no experience among sensible objectsof exact equality we see only approximate equality how then do we arrive at the idea ofabsolute equality or do we perhaps have no such idea let us take a concrete case the metre is defined as the length of a certain rod in paris at a certaintemperature what should we mean if we said of some other rod that its length was exactly onemetre i dont think we should mean anything we could say the most accurare processes ofmeasurement known to science at the present day fail to show that our rod is either longer orshorter than the standard metre in paris we might if we were sufficiently rash add a prophecythat no subsequent refinements in the technique of measurement will alter this result but this isstill an empirical statement in the sense that empirical evidence may at any moment disprove it ido not think we really possess the idea of absolute equality that plato supposes us to possess but even if we do it is clear that no child possesses it until it reaches a certain age and that theidea is elicited by experience although not directly derived from experience moreover unless ourexistence before birth was not one of senseperception it would have been as incapable ofgenerating the idea as this life is and if our previous existence is supposed to have been partlysupersensible why not make the same supposition concerning our present existence on all thesegrounds the argument fails the doctrine of reminiscence being considered established cebes says about half of what wasrequired has been proven to wit that our souls existed before we were born that the soul willexist after death as well as before birth is the other half of which the proof is still wantingsocrates accordingly applies himself to this he says that it follows from what was said abouteverything being generated from its opposite according to which death must generate life just asmuch as life generates death but he adds another argument which had a longer history inphilosophy that only what is complex can be dissolved and that the soul like the ideas is simpleand not compounded of parts what is simple it is thought cannot begin or end or change nowessences are unchanging absolute beauty for example is always the same whereas beautifulthings continually change thus things seen are temporal but things unseen are eternal the body is seen but thesoul is unseen therefore the soul is to be classified in the group of things that are eternal the soul being eternal is at home in the contemplation of eternal things that is essences but islost and confused when as in senseperception it contemplates the world of changing things the soul when using the body as an instrument of perception that is to say when using the senseof sight or hearing or some other sense  is then dragged by the body into the region of the changeableand wanders and is confused the world spins round her and she is like a drunkard when shetouches change  but when returning into herself she reflects then she passes into the otherworld the region of purity and eternity and immortality and unchangeableness which are herkindred and with them she ever lives when she is by herself and is not let or hindered then sheceases from her erring ways and being in communion with the unchanging is unchanging andthis state of the soul is called wisdom the soul of the true philosopher which has in life been liberated from thraldom to the flesh willafter death depart to the invisible world to live in bliss in the company of the gods but theimpure soul which has loved the body will become a ghost haunting the sepulchre or will enterinto the body of an animal such as an ass or wolf or hawk according to its character a man whohas been virtuous without being a philosopher will become a bee or wasp or ant or some otheranimal of a gregarious and social sort only the true philosopher goes to heaven when he dies no one who has not studied philosophyand who is not entirely pure at the time of his departure is allowed to enter the company of the gods but the lover of knowledge only that is why the true votaries of philosophy abstain fromfleshly lusts not that they fear poverty or disgrace but because they are conscious that the soulwas simply fastened or glued to the bodyuntil philosophy received her she could only view realexistence through the bars of a prison not in and through herself  and by reason of lust hadbecome the principal accomplice in her own captivity the philosopher will be

chapter xviii knowledge and perception in plato m ost modern men take it for granted that empirical knowledge is dependent upon or derivedfrom perception there is however in plato and among philosophers of certain other schools avery different doctrine to the effect that there is nothing worthy to be called knowledge to bederived from the senses and that the only real knowledge has to do with concepts in this view   is genuine knowledge but such a statement as snow is white is so full of ambiguity anduncertainty that it cannot find a place in the philosophers corpus of truths this view is perhaps traceable to parmenides but in its explicit form the philosophic world owesit to plato i propose in this chapter to deal only with platos criticism of the view that knowledgeis the same thing as perception which occupies the first half of the theaetetus this dialogue is concerned to find a definition of knowledge but ends without arriving at anybut a negative conclusion several definitions are proposed and rejected bur no definition that isconsidered satisfactory is suggested the first of the suggested definitions and the only one that i shall consider is set forth by theaetetus in the words it seems to me that one who knows something is perceiving the thing that he knows and so faras i can see at present knowledge is nothing but perception socrates identifies this doctrine with that of protagoras that man is the measure of all thingsie that any given thing is to me such as it appears to me and is to you such as it appears to yousocrates adds perception then is always something that is and as being knowledge it isinfallible a large part of the argument that follows is concerned with the characterization of perception when once this is completed it does not take long to prove thatsuch a thing as perception has turned out to be cannot be knowledge socrates adds to the doctrine of protagoras the doctrine of heraclitus that everything is alwayschanging ie that all the things we are pleased to say are really are in process of becomingplato believes this to be true of objects of sense but not of the objects of real knowledge throughout the dialogue however his positive doctrines remain in the background from the doctrine of heraclitus even if it be only applicable to objects of sense together with thedefinition of knowledge as perception it follows that knowledge is of what becomes not of whatis there are at this point some puzzles of a very elementary character we are told that since isgreater than but less than  is both great and small which is a contradiction again socratesis now taller than theaetetus who is a youth not yet full grown but in a few years socrates willbe shorter than theaetetus therefore socrates is both tall and short the idea of a relationalproposition seems to have puzzled plato as it did most of the great philosophers down to hegel these puzzles however are not very germane to the argument and may be ignored returning to perception it is regarded as due to an interaction between the object and the senseorgan both of which according to the doctrine of heraclitus are always changing and both ofwhich in changing change the percept socrates remarks that when he is well he finds winesweet but when ill sour here it is a change in the percipient that causes the change in thepercept certain objections to the doctrine of protagoras are advanced and some of these are subsequentlywithdrawn it is urged that protagoras ought equally to have admitted pigs and baboons aremeasures of all things since they also are percipients questions are raised as to the validity ofperception in dreams and in madness it is suggested that if protagoras is right one man knows nomore than another not only is protagoras as wise as the gods but what is more serious he is nowiser than a fool further if one mans judgements are as correct as anothers the people whojudge that protagoras is mistaken have the same reason to be thought right as he has socrates undertakes to find an answer to many of these objections 
characterization of perception when once this is completed it does not take long to prove thatsuch a thing as perception has turned out to be cannot be knowledge socrates adds to the doctrine of protagoras the doctrine of heraclitus that everything is alwayschanging ie that all the things we are pleased to say are really are in process of becomingplato believes this to be true of objects of sense but not of the objects of real knowledge throughout the dialogue however his positive doctrines remain in the background from the doctrine of heraclitus even if it be only applicable to objects of sense together with thedefinition of knowledge as perception it follows that knowledge is of what becomes not of whatis there are at this point some puzzles of a very elementary character we are told that since isgreater than but less than  is both great and small which is a contradiction again socratesis now taller than theaetetus who is a youth not yet full grown but in a few years socrates willbe shorter than theaetetus therefore socrates is both tall and short the idea of a relationalproposition seems to have puzzled plato as it did most of the great philosophers down to hegel these puzzles however are not very germane to the argument and may be ignored returning to perception it is regarded as due to an interaction between the object and the senseorgan both of which according to the doctrine of heraclitus are always changing and both ofwhich in changing change the percept socrates remarks that when he is well he finds winesweet but when ill sour here it is a change in the percipient that causes the change in thepercept certain objections to the doctrine of protagoras are advanced and some of these are subsequentlywithdrawn it is urged that protagoras ought equally to have admitted pigs and baboons aremeasures of all things since they also are percipients questions are raised as to the validity ofperception in dreams and in madness it is suggested that if protagoras is right one man knows nomore than another not only is protagoras as wise as the gods but what is more serious he is nowiser than a fool further if one mans judgements are as correct as anothers the people whojudge that protagoras is mistaken have the same reason to be thought right as he has socrates undertakes to find an answer to many of these objections putting himself for the moment in the place of protagoras as for dreams the percepts are trueas percepts as for the argument about pigs and baboons this is dismissed as vulgar abuse asfor the argument that if each man is the measure of all things one man is as wise as another socrates suggests on behalf of protagoras a very interesting answer namely that while onejudgement cannot be truer than another it can be better in the sense of having betterconsequences this suggests pragmatism this answer however though socrates has invented it does not satisfy him he urges forexample that when a doctor foretells the course of my illness he actually knows more of myfuture than i do and when men differ as to what it is wise for the state to decree the issueshows that some men had a greater knowledge as to the future than others had thus we cannotescape the conclusion that a wise man is a better measure of things than a fool all these are objections to the doctrine that each man is the measure of all things and onlyindirectly to the doctrine that knowledge means perception in so far as this doctrine leadsto the other there is however a direct argument namely that memory must be allowed as wellas perception this is admitted and to this extent the proposed definition is amended we come next to criticisms of the doctrine of heraclitus this is first pushed to extremes inaccordance we are told with the practice of his disciples among the bright youths of ephesus a thing may change in two ways by locomotion and by a change of quality and the doctrine offlux is held to state that everything is always changing in both respects and not only iseverything always undergoing some qualitative change but everything is always changing all itsqualitiesso we are told clever people think at ephesus this has  it was presumably this passage that first suggested to f c s schiller his admiration of protagoras it seems that neither plato nor the dynamic youths of ephesus had noticed that locomotionis impossible on the extreme heraclitean doctrine motion demands that a given thing ashould be now here now there it must remain the same thing while it moves in thedoctrine that plato examines there is change of quality and change of place but not changeof substance in this respect modern quantum physics goes further than the most extremedisciples of heraclitus went in platos time plato would have thought this fatal to sciencebut it has not proved so

putting himself for the moment in the place of protagoras as for dreams the percepts are trueas percepts as for the argument about pigs and baboons this is dismissed as vulgar abuse asfor the argument that if each man is the measure of all things one man is as wise as another socrates suggests on behalf of protagoras a very interesting answer namely that while onejudgement cannot be truer than another it can be better in the sense of having betterconsequences this suggests pragmatism this answer however though socrates has invented it does not satisfy him he urges forexample that when a doctor foretells the course of my illness he actually knows more of myfuture than i do and when men differ as to what it is wise for the state to decree the issueshows that some men had a greater knowledge as to the future than others had thus we cannotescape the conclusion that a wise man is a better measure of things than a fool all these are objections to the doctrine that each man is the measure of all things and onlyindirectly to the doctrine that knowledge means perception in so far as this doctrine leadsto the other there is however a direct argument namely that memory must be allowed as wellas perception this is admitted and to this extent the proposed definition is amended we come next to criticisms of the doctrine of heraclitus this is first pushed to extremes inaccordance we are told with the practice of his disciples among the bright youths of ephesus a thing may change in two ways by locomotion and by a change of quality and the doctrine offlux is held to state that everything is always changing in both respects and not only iseverything always undergoing some qualitative change but everything is always changing all itsqualitiesso we are told clever people think at ephesus this has  it was presumably this passage that first suggested to f c s schiller his admiration of protagoras it seems that neither plato nor the dynamic youths of ephesus had noticed that locomotionis impossible on the extreme heraclitean doctrine motion demands that a given thing ashould be now here now there it must remain the same thing while it moves in thedoctrine that plato examines there is change of quality and change of place but not changeof substance in this respect modern quantum physics goes further than the most extremedisciples of heraclitus went in platos time plato would have thought this fatal to sciencebut it has not proved so awkward consequences we cannot say this is white for if it was white when we beganspeaking it will have ceased to be white before we end our sentence we cannot be right insaying we are seeing a thing for seeing is perpetually changing into notseeing if everythingis changing in every kind of way seeing has no right to be called seeing rather than notseeingor perception to be called perception rather than notperception and when we say perceptionis knowledge we might just as well say perception is notknowledge what the above argument amounts to is that whatever else may be in perpetual flux themeanings of words must be fixed at least for a time since otherwise no assertion is definiteand no assertion is true rather than false there must be something more or less constant ifdiscourse and knowledge are to be possible this i think should be admitted but a great dealof flux is compatible with this admission there is at this point a refusal to discuss parmenides on the ground that he is too great andgrand he is a reverend and awful figure there was a sort of depth in him that wasaltogether noble he is one being whom i respect above all in these remarks plato shows hislove for a static universe and his dislike of the heraclitean flux which he has been admitting forthe sake of argument but after this expression of reverence he abstains from developing the parmenidean alternative to heraclitus we now reach platos final argument against the identification of knowledge with perception he begins by pointing out that we perceive through eyes and ears rather than with them and hegoes on to point out that some of our knowledge is not connected with any senseorgan we canknow for instance that sounds and colours are unlike though no organ of sense can perceiveboth there is no special organ for existence and nonexistence likeness and unlikenesssameness and differences and also unity and numbers in general the same applies tohonourable and dishonourable and good and bad the mind contemplates some things throughits own instrumentality others through the bodily faculties we perceive hard and soft throughtouch but it is the mind that judges that they exist and that they are contraries only the mindcan reach existence and we can  compare the advertisement thats shell that was not reach truth if we do not reach existence it follows that we cannot know things through thesenses alone since through the senses alone we cannot know that things exist thereforeknowledge consists in reflection not in impressions and perception is not knowledge becauseit has no part in apprehending truth since it has none in apprehending existencetodisentangle what can be accepted from what must be rejected in this argument against theidentification of knowledge with perception is by no means easy there are three interconnected theses that plato discusses namely knowledge is perception man is the measure of all things everything is in a state of flux

 the first of these with which alone the argument is primarily concerned is hardly discussedon its own account except in the final passage with which we have just been concerned here itis argued that comparison knowledge of existence and understanding of number are essentialto knowledge but cannot be included in perception since they are not effected through anysenseorgan the things to be said about these are different let us begin with likeness andunlikeness that two shades of colour both of which i am seeing are similar or dissimilar as the case maybe is something which i for my part should accept not indeed as a percept but as ajudgement of perception a percept i should say is not knowledge but merely somethingthat happens and that belongs equally to the world of physics and to the world of psychology we naturally think of perception as plato does as a relation between a percipient and an objectwe say i see a table but here i and table are logical constructions the core of crudeoccurrence is merely certain patches of colour these are associated with images of touch theymay cause words and they may become a source of memories the percept as filled out withimages of touch becomes an object which is supposed physical the percept as filled out withwords and memories becomes a perception which is part of a subject and is consideredmental the percept is just an occurrence and neither true nor false the percept as filled outwith words is a judgement and capable of truth or falsehood this judgement i call a judgement of perception the proposition knowledge is perception must beinterpreted as meaning knowledge is judgements of perception it is only in this form that it isgrammatically capable of being correct to return to likeness and unlikeness it is quite possible when i perceive two colourssimultaneously for their likeness or unlikeness to be part of the datum and to be asserted in ajudgement of perception platos argument that we have no senseorgan for perceiving likenessand unlikeness ignores the cortex and assumes that all senseorgans must be at the surface of thebody the argument for including likeness and unlikeness as possible perceptive data is as follows letus assume that we see two shades of colour a and b and that we judge a is like b let usassume further as plato does that such a judgement is in general correct and in particular iscorrect in the case we are considering there is then a relation of likeness between a and b andnot merely a judgement on our part asserting likeness if there were only our judgement it wouldbe an arbitrary judgement incapable of truth or falsehood since it obviously is capable of truth orfalsehood the likeness can subsist between a and b and cannot be merely something mentalthe judgement a is like b is true in virtue of a fact just as much as thejudgement a is red or a is round the mind is no more involved in the perception of likenessthan in the perception of colour i come now to existence on which plato lays great stress we have he says as regards sound andcolour a thought which includes both at once namely that they exist existence belongs toeverything and is among the things that the mind apprehends by itself without reachingexistence it is impossible to reach truth the argument against plato here is quite different from that in the case of likeness and unlikeness the argument here is that all that plato says about existence is bad grammar or rather bad syntax this point is important not only in connection with plato but also with other matters such as theontological argument for the existence of the deity suppose you say to a child lions exist but unicorns dont you can prove your point so far aslions are concerned by taking him to the zoo and saying look thats a lion you will not unlessyou are a 
judgement i call a judgement of perception the proposition knowledge is perception must beinterpreted as meaning knowledge is judgements of perception it is only in this form that it isgrammatically capable of being correct to return to likeness and unlikeness it is quite possible when i perceive two colourssimultaneously for their likeness or unlikeness to be part of the datum and to be asserted in ajudgement of perception platos argument that we have no senseorgan for perceiving likenessand unlikeness ignores the cortex and assumes that all senseorgans must be at the surface of thebody the argument for including likeness and unlikeness as possible perceptive data is as follows letus assume that we see two shades of colour a and b and that we judge a is like b let usassume further as plato does that such a judgement is in general correct and in particular iscorrect in the case we are considering there is then a relation of likeness between a and b andnot merely a judgement on our part asserting likeness if there were only our judgement it wouldbe an arbitrary judgement incapable of truth or falsehood since it obviously is capable of truth orfalsehood the likeness can subsist between a and b and cannot be merely something mentalthe judgement a is like b is true in virtue of a fact just as much as thejudgement a is red or a is round the mind is no more involved in the perception of likenessthan in the perception of colour i come now to existence on which plato lays great stress we have he says as regards sound andcolour a thought which includes both at once namely that they exist existence belongs toeverything and is among the things that the mind apprehends by itself without reachingexistence it is impossible to reach truth the argument against plato here is quite different from that in the case of likeness and unlikeness the argument here is that all that plato says about existence is bad grammar or rather bad syntax this point is important not only in connection with plato but also with other matters such as theontological argument for the existence of the deity suppose you say to a child lions exist but unicorns dont you can prove your point so far aslions are concerned by taking him to the zoo and saying look thats a lion you will not unlessyou are a philosopher add and you can see that that exists if being a philosopher you do add thisyou are uttering nonsense to say lions exist means there are lions ie x is a lion is truefor a suitable x but we cannot say of the suitable x that it exists we can only apply this verbto a description complete or incomplete lion is an incomplete description because it appliesto many objects the largest lion in the zoo is complete because it applies to only one object now suppose that i am looking at a bright red patch i may say this is my present percept imay also say my present percept exists but i must not say this exists because the wordexists is only significant when applied to a description as opposed to a name this disposesof existence as one of the things that the mind is aware of in objects i come now to understanding of numbers here there are two very different things to beconsidered on the one hand the propositions of arithmetic and on the other hand empiricalpropositions of enumeration   is of the former kind i have ten fingers is of thelatter i should agree with plato that arithmetic and pure mathematics generally is not derived fromperception pure mathematics consists of tautologies analogous to men are men but usuallymore complicated to know that a mathematical proposition is correct we do not have to studythe world but only the meanings of the symbols and the symbols when we dispense withdefinitions are found to be such words as orand not and all and some which do not like socrates denote anything in the actualworld a mathematical equation asserts that two groups of symbols have the same meaning andso long as we confine ourselves to pure mathematics this meaning must be one that can beunderstood without knowing anything about what can be perceived mathematical truththerefore is as plato contends independent of perception but it is truth of a very peculiar sortand is concerned only with symbols propositions of enumeration such as i have ten fingers are in quite a different category andare obviously at least in part dependent  on this subject see the last chapter of the present work 
philosopher add and you can see that that exists if being a philosopher you do add thisyou are uttering nonsense to say lions exist means there are lions ie x is a lion is truefor a suitable x but we cannot say of the suitable x that it exists we can only apply this verbto a description complete or incomplete lion is an incomplete description because it appliesto many objects the largest lion in the zoo is complete because it applies to only one object now suppose that i am looking at a bright red patch i may say this is my present percept imay also say my present percept exists but i must not say this exists because the wordexists is only significant when applied to a description as opposed to a name this disposesof existence as one of the things that the mind is aware of in objects i come now to understanding of numbers here there are two very different things to beconsidered on the one hand the propositions of arithmetic and on the other hand empiricalpropositions of enumeration   is of the former kind i have ten fingers is of thelatter i should agree with plato that arithmetic and pure mathematics generally is not derived fromperception pure mathematics consists of tautologies analogous to men are men but usuallymore complicated to know that a mathematical proposition is correct we do not have to studythe world but only the meanings of the symbols and the symbols when we dispense withdefinitions are found to be such words as orand not and all and some which do not like socrates denote anything in the actualworld a mathematical equation asserts that two groups of symbols have the same meaning andso long as we confine ourselves to pure mathematics this meaning must be one that can beunderstood without knowing anything about what can be perceived mathematical truththerefore is as plato contends independent of perception but it is truth of a very peculiar sortand is concerned only with symbols propositions of enumeration such as i have ten fingers are in quite a different category andare obviously at least in part dependent  on this subject see the last chapter of the present work on perception clearly the concept finger is abstracted from perception but how about theconcept ten here we may seem to have arrived at a true universal or platonic idea we cannotsay that ten is abstracted from perception for any percept which can be viewed as ten of somekind of thing can equally well be viewed otherwise suppose i give the name digitary to all thefingers of one hand taken together then i can say i have two digitaries and this describes thesame fact of perception as i formerly described by the help of the number ten thus in thestatement i have ten fingers perception plays a smaller part and conception a larger part than insuch a statement as this is red the matter however is only one of degree the complete answer as regards propositions in which the word ten occurs is that when thesepropositions are correctly analysed they are found to contain no constituent corresponding to theword ten to explain this in the case of such a large number as ten would be complicated let ustherefore substitute i have two hands this means there is an a such that there is a b such that a and b are not identical and whatever x may be x isa hand of mine is true when and only when x is a or x is b here the word two does not occur it is true that two letters a and b occur but we do not need to know that they are two any more than we need to know that they are black or white or whatevercolour they may happen to be thus numbers are in a certain precise sense formal the facts which verify various propositionsasserting that various collections each have two members have in common not a constituent buta form in this they differ from propositions about the statue of liberty or the moon or george washington such propositions refer to a particular portion of spacetime it is this that is incommon between all the statements that can be made about the statue of liberty but there isnothing in common among propositions there are two soandsos except a common form therelation of the symbol two to the meaning of a proposition in which it occurs is far morecomplicated than the relation of the symbol red to the meaning of a proposition in which itoccurs we may say in a certain sense that the symbol two means nothing for when it occursin a true state 
on perception clearly the concept finger is abstracted from perception but how about theconcept ten here we may seem to have arrived at a true universal or platonic idea we cannotsay that ten is abstracted from perception for any percept which can be viewed as ten of somekind of thing can equally well be viewed otherwise suppose i give the name digitary to all thefingers of one hand taken together then i can say i have two digitaries and this describes thesame fact of perception as i formerly described by the help of the number ten thus in thestatement i have ten fingers perception plays a smaller part and conception a larger part than insuch a statement as this is red the matter however is only one of degree the complete answer as regards propositions in which the word ten occurs is that when thesepropositions are correctly analysed they are found to contain no constituent corresponding to theword ten to explain this in the case of such a large number as ten would be complicated let ustherefore substitute i have two hands this means there is an a such that there is a b such that a and b are not identical and whatever x may be x isa hand of mine is true when and only when x is a or x is b here the word two does not occur it is true that two letters a and b occur but we do not need to know that they are two any more than we need to know that they are black or white or whatevercolour they may happen to be thus numbers are in a certain precise sense formal the facts which verify various propositionsasserting that various collections each have two members have in common not a constituent buta form in this they differ from propositions about the statue of liberty or the moon or george washington such propositions refer to a particular portion of spacetime it is this that is incommon between all the statements that can be made about the statue of liberty but there isnothing in common among propositions there are two soandsos except a common form therelation of the symbol two to the meaning of a proposition in which it occurs is far morecomplicated than the relation of the symbol red to the meaning of a proposition in which itoccurs we may say in a certain sense that the symbol two means nothing for when it occursin a true state ment there is no corresponding constituent in the meaning of the statement we may continue ifwe like to say that numbers are eternal immutable and so on but we must add that they arelogical fictions there is a further point concerning sound and colour plato says both together are two and eachof them is one we have considered the two now we must consider the one there is here amistake very analogous to that concerning existence the predicate one is not applicable tothings but only to unit classes we can say the earth has one satellite but it is a syntactical errorto say the moon is one for what can such an assertion mean you may just as well say themoon is many since it has many parts to say the earth has one satellite is to give a property ofthe concept earths satellite namely the following property there is a c such that x is a satellite of the earth is true when and only when x is c this is an astronomical truth but if for a satellite of the earth you substitute the moon or anyother proper name the result is either meaningless or a mere tautology one therefore is aproperty of certain concepts just as ten is a property of the concept my finger but to arguethe earth has one satellite namely the moon therefore the moon is one is as bad as to argue the apostles were twelve peter was an apostle therefore peter was twelve which would be valid iffor twelve we substituted white the above considerations have shown that while there is a formal kind of knowledge namelylogic and mathematics which is not derived from perception platos arguments as regards allother knowledge are fallacious this does not of course prove that his conclusion is false itproves only that he has given no valid reason for supposing it true i come now to the position of protagoras that man is the measure of all things or as it isinterpreted that each man is the measure of all things here it is essential to decide the level uponwhich the discussion is to proceed it is obvious that to begin with we must distinguish betweenpercepts and inferences among percepts each man is inevitably confined to his own what heknows of the percepts of others he knows by inference from his own percepts in hearing andreading the percepts of dreamers and madmen as 
ment there is no corresponding constituent in the meaning of the statement we may continue ifwe like to say that numbers are eternal immutable and so on but we must add that they arelogical fictions there is a further point concerning sound and colour plato says both together are two and eachof them is one we have considered the two now we must consider the one there is here amistake very analogous to that concerning existence the predicate one is not applicable tothings but only to unit classes we can say the earth has one satellite but it is a syntactical errorto say the moon is one for what can such an assertion mean you may just as well say themoon is many since it has many parts to say the earth has one satellite is to give a property ofthe concept earths satellite namely the following property there is a c such that x is a satellite of the earth is true when and only when x is c this is an astronomical truth but if for a satellite of the earth you substitute the moon or anyother proper name the result is either meaningless or a mere tautology one therefore is aproperty of certain concepts just as ten is a property of the concept my finger but to arguethe earth has one satellite namely the moon therefore the moon is one is as bad as to argue the apostles were twelve peter was an apostle therefore peter was twelve which would be valid iffor twelve we substituted white the above considerations have shown that while there is a formal kind of knowledge namelylogic and mathematics which is not derived from perception platos arguments as regards allother knowledge are fallacious this does not of course prove that his conclusion is false itproves only that he has given no valid reason for supposing it true i come now to the position of protagoras that man is the measure of all things or as it isinterpreted that each man is the measure of all things here it is essential to decide the level uponwhich the discussion is to proceed it is obvious that to begin with we must distinguish betweenpercepts and inferences among percepts each man is inevitably confined to his own what heknows of the percepts of others he knows by inference from his own percepts in hearing andreading the percepts of dreamers and madmen as percepts are just as good as those of others the only objection to them is that as their context isunusual they are apt to give rise to fallacious inferences but how about inferences are they equally personal and private in a sense we must admit thatthey are what i am to believe i must believe because of some reason that appeals to me it is truethat my reason may be some one elses assertion but that may be a perfectly adequate reasonforinstance if i am a judge listening to evidence and however protagorean i may be it is reasonableto accept the opinion of an accountant about a set of figures in preference to my own for i mayhave repeatedly found that if at first i disagree with him a little more care shows me that he wasright in this sense i may admit that another man is wiser than i am the protagorean positionrightly interpreted does not involve the view that i never make mistakes but only that theevidence of my mistakes must appear to me my past self can be judged just as another person canbe judged but all this presupposes that as regards inferences as opposed to percepts there issome impersonal standard of correctness if any inference that i happen to draw is just as good asany other then the intellectual anarchy that plato deduces from protagoras does in fact follow onthis point therefore which is an important one plato seems to be in the right but the empiricistwould say that perceptions are the test of correctness in inference in empirical material the doctrine of universal flux is caricatured by plato and it is difficult to suppose that any oneever held it in the extreme form that he gives to it let us suppose for example that the colourswe see are continually changing such a word as red applies to many shades of colour and if wesay i see red there is no reason why this should not remain true throughout the time that it takesto say it plato gets his results by applying to processes of continuous change such logicaloppositions as perceiving and notperceiving knowing and notknowing such oppositionshowever are not suitable for describing such processes suppose on a foggy day you watch aman walking away from you along a road he grows dimmer and dimmer and there comes amoment when you are sure that you no longer see him but there is an intermediate period ofdoubt logical oppositions have been invented for our convenience but continuous changerequires a quantitative apparatus the possibility of which plato 
percepts are just as good as those of others the only objection to them is that as their context isunusual they are apt to give rise to fallacious inferences but how about inferences are they equally personal and private in a sense we must admit thatthey are what i am to believe i must believe because of some reason that appeals to me it is truethat my reason may be some one elses assertion but that may be a perfectly adequate reasonforinstance if i am a judge listening to evidence and however protagorean i may be it is reasonableto accept the opinion of an accountant about a set of figures in preference to my own for i mayhave repeatedly found that if at first i disagree with him a little more care shows me that he wasright in this sense i may admit that another man is wiser than i am the protagorean positionrightly interpreted does not involve the view that i never make mistakes but only that theevidence of my mistakes must appear to me my past self can be judged just as another person canbe judged but all this presupposes that as regards inferences as opposed to percepts there issome impersonal standard of correctness if any inference that i happen to draw is just as good asany other then the intellectual anarchy that plato deduces from protagoras does in fact follow onthis point therefore which is an important one plato seems to be in the right but the empiricistwould say that perceptions are the test of correctness in inference in empirical material the doctrine of universal flux is caricatured by plato and it is difficult to suppose that any oneever held it in the extreme form that he gives to it let us suppose for example that the colourswe see are continually changing such a word as red applies to many shades of colour and if wesay i see red there is no reason why this should not remain true throughout the time that it takesto say it plato gets his results by applying to processes of continuous change such logicaloppositions as perceiving and notperceiving knowing and notknowing such oppositionshowever are not suitable for describing such processes suppose on a foggy day you watch aman walking away from you along a road he grows dimmer and dimmer and there comes amoment when you are sure that you no longer see him but there is an intermediate period ofdoubt logical oppositions have been invented for our convenience but continuous changerequires a quantitative apparatus the possibility of which plato ignores what he says on this subject therefore is largely beside the mark at the same time it must be admitted that unless words to some extent had fixed meaningsdiscourse would be impossible here again however it is easy to be too absolute words dochange their meanings take for example the word idea it is only by a considerable process ofeducation that we learn to give to this word something like the meaning which plato gave to it itis necessary that the changes in the meanings of words should be slower than the changes that thewords describe but it is not necessary that there should be no changes in the meanings of words perhaps this does not apply to the abstract words of logic and mathematics but these words as wehave seen apply only to the form not to the matter of propositions here again we find thatlogic and mathematics are peculiar plato under the influence of the pythagoreans assimilatedother knowledge too much to mathematics he shared this mistake with many of the greatestphilosophers but it was a mistake none the less chapter xix aristotles metaphysics in reading any important philosopher but most of all in reading aristotle it is necessary to studyhim in two ways with reference to his predecessors and with reference to his successors in theformer aspect aristotles merits are enormous in the latter his demerits are equally enormous for his demerits however his successors are more responsible than he is he came at the end ofthe creative period in greek thought and after his death it was two thousand years before theworld produced any philosopher who could be regarded as approximately his equal towards theend of this long period his authority had become almost as unquestioned as that of the churchand in science as well as in philosophy had become a serious obstacle to progress ever since thebeginning of 
ignores what he says on this subject therefore is largely beside the mark at the same time it must be admitted that unless words to some extent had fixed meaningsdiscourse would be impossible here again however it is easy to be too absolute words dochange their meanings take for example the word idea it is only by a considerable process ofeducation that we learn to give to this word something like the meaning which plato gave to it itis necessary that the changes in the meanings of words should be slower than the changes that thewords describe but it is not necessary that there should be no changes in the meanings of words perhaps this does not apply to the abstract words of logic and mathematics but these words as wehave seen apply only to the form not to the matter of propositions here again we find thatlogic and mathematics are peculiar plato under the influence of the pythagoreans assimilatedother knowledge too much to mathematics he shared this mistake with many of the greatestphilosophers but it was a mistake none the less chapter xix aristotles metaphysics in reading any important philosopher but most of all in reading aristotle it is necessary to studyhim in two ways with reference to his predecessors and with reference to his successors in theformer aspect aristotles merits are enormous in the latter his demerits are equally enormous for his demerits however his successors are more responsible than he is he came at the end ofthe creative period in greek thought and after his death it was two thousand years before theworld produced any philosopher who could be regarded as approximately his equal towards theend of this long period his authority had become almost as unquestioned as that of the churchand in science as well as in philosophy had become a serious obstacle to progress ever since thebeginning of the seventeenth century almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with anattack on some aristotelian doctrine in logic this is still true at the present day but it wouldhave been at least as disastrous if any of his predecessors hadacquired equal authority to do him justice we must to begin with forget his excessiveposthumous fame and the equally excessive posthumous condemnation to which it led aristotle was born probably in bc at stagyra in thrace his father had inherited theposition of family physician to the king of macedonia at about the age of eighteen aristotlecame to athens and became a pupil of plato he remained in the academy for nearly twentyyears until the death of plato in bc he then travelled for a time and married either thesister or the niece of a tyrant named hermias in bc hebecame tutor to alexander then thirteen years old and continued in that position until at theage of sixteen s was pronounced by his father to be of age and was appointed regent during philips absence everything one would wish to know of the relations of aristotle and alexander is unascertainable the more so as legends were soon invented on the subject thereare letters between them which are generally regarded as forgeries people who admire bothmen suppose that the tutor influenced the pupil hegel thinks that alexanders career shows thepractical usefulness of philosophy as to this a w benn says it would be unfortunate ifphilosophy had no better testimonial to show for herself than the character of alexander  arrogant drunken cruel vindictive and grossly superstitious he united the vices of a highlandchieftain to the frenzy of an oriental despot for my part while i agree with benn about the character of alexander i nevertheless think thathis work was enormously important and enormously beneficial since but for him the wholetradition of hellenic civilization might well have perished as to aristotles influence on himwe are left free to conjecture whatever seems to us most plausible for my part i shouldsuppose it nil alexander was an ambitious and passionate boy on bad terms with his fatherand  the greek philosophers vol i p

detail and in criticism he fails in large construction for lack of fundamental clarity and titanicfire it is difficult to decide at what point to begin an account of aristotles metaphysics but perhapsthe best place is his criticism of the theory of ideas and his own alternative doctrine of universals he advances against the ideas a number of very good arguments most of which are already to befound in plato parmenides the strongest argument is that of the third man if a man is a manbecause he resembles the ideal man there must be a still more ideal man to whom both ordinarymen and the ideal man are similar again socrates is both a man and an animal and the questionarises whether the ideal man is an ideal animal if he is there must be as many ideal animals asthere are species of animals it is needless to pursue the matter aristotle makes it obvious thatwhen a number of individuals share a predicate this cannot be because of relation to something ofthe same kind as themselves but more ideal this much may be taken as proved but aristotlesown doctrine is far from clear it was this lack of clarity that made possible the medievalcontroversy between nominalists and realists aristotles metaphysics roughly speaking may be described as plato diluted by common sense he is difficult because plato and common sense do not mix easily when one tries to understandhim one thinks part of the time that he is expressing the ordinary views of a person innocent ofphilosophy and the rest of the time that he is setting forth platonism with a new vocabulary itdoes not do to lay too much stress on any single passage because there is liable to be a correctionor modification of it in some later passage on the whole the easiest way to understand both histheory of universals and his theory of matter and form is to set forth first the commonsensedoctrine which is half of his view and then to consider the platonic modifications to which hesubjects it up to a certain point the theory of universals is quite simple in language there are proper namesand there are adjectives the proper names apply to things or persons each of which is theonly thing or person to which the name in question applies the sun the moon france napoleonare unique there are not a number of instances of things to which these names apply on the otherhand words like cat dog man apply to many different things the problem of universals is concerned with the meanings of such words and also of adjectivessuch as white hard round and so on he says by the term universal i mean thatwhich is of such a nature as to be predicated of many subjects by individual that which is notthus predicated what is signified by a proper name is a substance while what is signified by an adjective orclassname such as human or man is called a universal a substance is a this but auniversal is a suchit indicates the sort of thing not the actual particular thing a universal isnot a substance because it is not a this it seemsimpossible aristotle says that any universal term should be the name of a substance for  the substance of each thing is that which is peculiar to it which does not belong to anythingelse but the universal is common since that is called universal which is such as to belong tomore than one thing the gist of the matter so far is that a universal cannot exist by itself butonly in particular things superficially aristotles doctrine is plain enough suppose i say there is such a thing as thegame of football most people would regard the remark as a truism but if i were to infer thatfootball could exist without footballplayers i should be rightly held to be talking nonsense similarly it would be held there is such a thing as parenthood but only because there areparents there is such a thing as sweetness but only because there are sweet things and there isredness but only because there are red things and this dependence is thought to be notreciprocal the men who play football would still exist even if they never played football thingswhich are usually sweet may turn sour and my face which is usually red may turn pale withoutceasing to be my face in this way we are led to conclude that what is meant by an adjective isdependent for its being on what is meant by a proper name but not vice versa this is i thinkwhat aristotle means his doctrine on this point as on many others is a commonsenseprejudice pedantically expressed but it is not easy to give precision to the theory granted that football could not exist withoutfootballplayers it could perfectly well  on interpretation a 
problem of universals is concerned with the meanings of such words and also of adjectivessuch as white hard round and so on he says by the term universal i mean thatwhich is of such a nature as to be predicated of many subjects by individual that which is notthus predicated what is signified by a proper name is a substance while what is signified by an adjective orclassname such as human or man is called a universal a substance is a this but auniversal is a suchit indicates the sort of thing not the actual particular thing a universal isnot a substance because it is not a this it seemsimpossible aristotle says that any universal term should be the name of a substance for  the substance of each thing is that which is peculiar to it which does not belong to anythingelse but the universal is common since that is called universal which is such as to belong tomore than one thing the gist of the matter so far is that a universal cannot exist by itself butonly in particular things superficially aristotles doctrine is plain enough suppose i say there is such a thing as thegame of football most people would regard the remark as a truism but if i were to infer thatfootball could exist without footballplayers i should be rightly held to be talking nonsense similarly it would be held there is such a thing as parenthood but only because there areparents there is such a thing as sweetness but only because there are sweet things and there isredness but only because there are red things and this dependence is thought to be notreciprocal the men who play football would still exist even if they never played football thingswhich are usually sweet may turn sour and my face which is usually red may turn pale withoutceasing to be my face in this way we are led to conclude that what is meant by an adjective isdependent for its being on what is meant by a proper name but not vice versa this is i thinkwhat aristotle means his doctrine on this point as on many others is a commonsenseprejudice pedantically expressed but it is not easy to give precision to the theory granted that football could not exist withoutfootballplayers it could perfectly well  on interpretation a exist without this or that footballplayer and granted that a person can exist without playingfootball he nevertheless cannot exist without doing something the quality redness cannot existwithout some subject but it can exist without this or that subject similarly a subject cannot existwithout some quality but can exist without this or that quality the supposed ground for thedistinction between things and qualities thus seems to be illusory the true ground of the distinction is in fact linguistic it is derived from syntax there are propernames adjectives and relationwords we may say john is wise james is foolish john is tallerthan james here john and james are proper names wise and foolish are adjectives andtaller is a relationword metaphysicians ever since aristotle have interpreted these syntacticaldifferences metaphysically john and james are substances wisdom and folly are universals it may be that given sufficient caremetaphysical differences can be found that have some relation to these syntactical differences butif so it will be only by means of a long process involving incidentally the creation of anartificial philosophical language and this language will contain no such names as john and james and no such adjectives as wise and foolish all the words of ordinary languages willhave yielded to analysis and been replaced by words having a less complex significance untilthis labour has been performed the question of particulars and universals cannot be adequatelydiscussed and when we reach the point at which we can at last discuss it we shall find that thequestion we are discussing is quite quite different from what we supposed it to be at the outset if therefore i have failed to make aristotles theory of universals clear that is because it is not clear but it is certainly an advance on the theory of ideas and is certainlyconcerned with a genuine and very important problem there is another term which is important in aristotle and in his scholastic followers and that isthe term essence this is by no means synonymous with universal your essence is whatyou are by your very nature it is one may say those of your properties which you cannot losewithout ceasing to be yourself not only an individual thing but a species has an essence thedefinition of a species should consist in mentioning its essence i shall return to the conception of 
exist without this or that footballplayer and granted that a person can exist without playingfootball he nevertheless cannot exist without doing something the quality redness cannot existwithout some subject but it can exist without this or that subject similarly a subject cannot existwithout some quality but can exist without this or that quality the supposed ground for thedistinction between things and qualities thus seems to be illusory the true ground of the distinction is in fact linguistic it is derived from syntax there are propernames adjectives and relationwords we may say john is wise james is foolish john is tallerthan james here john and james are proper names wise and foolish are adjectives andtaller is a relationword metaphysicians ever since aristotle have interpreted these syntacticaldifferences metaphysically john and james are substances wisdom and folly are universals it may be that given sufficient caremetaphysical differences can be found that have some relation to these syntactical differences butif so it will be only by means of a long process involving incidentally the creation of anartificial philosophical language and this language will contain no such names as john and james and no such adjectives as wise and foolish all the words of ordinary languages willhave yielded to analysis and been replaced by words having a less complex significance untilthis labour has been performed the question of particulars and universals cannot be adequatelydiscussed and when we reach the point at which we can at last discuss it we shall find that thequestion we are discussing is quite quite different from what we supposed it to be at the outset if therefore i have failed to make aristotles theory of universals clear that is because it is not clear but it is certainly an advance on the theory of ideas and is certainlyconcerned with a genuine and very important problem there is another term which is important in aristotle and in his scholastic followers and that isthe term essence this is by no means synonymous with universal your essence is whatyou are by your very nature it is one may say those of your properties which you cannot losewithout ceasing to be yourself not only an individual thing but a species has an essence thedefinition of a species should consist in mentioning its essence i shall return to the conception of essence in connection with aristotles logic for the present i will merely observe that it seemsto me a muddleheaded action incapable of precision the next point in aristotles metaphysics is the distinction of form and matter here again there is a commonsense basis for aristotles theory but here more than in the caseof universals the platonic modifications are very important we may start with a marble statuehere marble is the matter while the shape conferred by the sculptor is the form or to take aristotles examples if a man makes a bronze sphere bronze is the matter and sphericity is theform while in the case of a calm sea water is the matter and smoothness is the form so far all issimple he goes on to say that it is in virtue of the form that the matter is some one definite thing and thisis the substance of the thing what aristotle means seems to be plain common sense a thingmust be bounded and the boundary constitutes its form take say a volume of water any part ofit can be marked off from the rest by being enclosed in a vessel and then this part becomes athing but so long as the part is in no way marked out from the rest of the homogeneous mass itis not a thing a statue is a thing and the marble of which it is composed is in a senseunchanged from what it was as part of a lump or as part of the contents of a quarry we should notnaturally say that it is the form that confers substantiality but that is because the atomichypothesis is ingrained in our imagination each atom however if it is a thing is so in virtue ofits being delimited from other atoms and so having in some sense a form we now come to a new statement which at first sight seems difficult the soul we are told is theform of the body here it is clear that form does not mean shape i shall return later to thesense in which the soul is the form of the body for the present i will only observe that in aristotles system the soul is what makes the body one thing having unity of purpose and thecharacteristics that we associate with the word organism the purpose of an eye is to see but itcannot see when parted from its body in fact it is the soul that sees it would seem then that form is what gives unity to a portion 
essence in connection with aristotles logic for the present i will merely observe that it seemsto me a muddleheaded action incapable of precision the next point in aristotles metaphysics is the distinction of form and matter here again there is a commonsense basis for aristotles theory but here more than in the caseof universals the platonic modifications are very important we may start with a marble statuehere marble is the matter while the shape conferred by the sculptor is the form or to take aristotles examples if a man makes a bronze sphere bronze is the matter and sphericity is theform while in the case of a calm sea water is the matter and smoothness is the form so far all issimple he goes on to say that it is in virtue of the form that the matter is some one definite thing and thisis the substance of the thing what aristotle means seems to be plain common sense a thingmust be bounded and the boundary constitutes its form take say a volume of water any part ofit can be marked off from the rest by being enclosed in a vessel and then this part becomes athing but so long as the part is in no way marked out from the rest of the homogeneous mass itis not a thing a statue is a thing and the marble of which it is composed is in a senseunchanged from what it was as part of a lump or as part of the contents of a quarry we should notnaturally say that it is the form that confers substantiality but that is because the atomichypothesis is ingrained in our imagination each atom however if it is a thing is so in virtue ofits being delimited from other atoms and so having in some sense a form we now come to a new statement which at first sight seems difficult the soul we are told is theform of the body here it is clear that form does not mean shape i shall return later to thesense in which the soul is the form of the body for the present i will only observe that in aristotles system the soul is what makes the body one thing having unity of purpose and thecharacteristics that we associate with the word organism the purpose of an eye is to see but itcannot see when parted from its body in fact it is the soul that sees it would seem then that form is what gives unity to a portion of matter and that this unity is usually if not always teleological but form turns out to bemuch more than this and the more is very difficult the form of a thing we are told is its essence and primary substance forms are substantialalthough universals are not when a man makes a brazen sphere both the matter and the formalready existed and all that he does is to bring them together the man does not make the formany more than he makes the brass not everything has matter there are eternal things and thesehave no matter except those of them that are movable in space things increase in actuality byacquiring form matter without form is only a potentiality the view that forms are substances which exist independently of the matter in which they areexemplified seems to expose aristotle to his own arguments against platonic ideas a form isintended by him to be something quite different from a universal but it has many of the samecharacteristics form is we are told more real than matter this is reminiscent of the sole realityof the ideas the change that aristotle makes in platos metaphysic is it would seem less thanhe represents it as being this view is taken by zeller who on the question of matter and formsays the final explanation of aristotles want of clearness on this subject is however to be found inthe fact that he had only half emancipated himself as we shall see from platos tendency tohypostatise ideas the forms had for him as the ideas had for plato a metaphysical existenceof their own as conditioning all individual things and keenly as he followed the growth ofideas out of experience it is none the less true that these ideas especially at the point wherethey are farthest removed from experience and immediate perception are metamorphosed in theend from a logical product of human thought into an immediate presentment of a supersensibleworld and the object in that sense of an intellectual intuition i do not see how aristotle could have found a reply to this criticism the only answer that i can imagine would be one that maintained that no two things could havethe same form if a man makes two brass spheres each has its ownspecial  aristotle vol i p  
of matter and that this unity is usually if not always teleological but form turns out to bemuch more than this and the more is very difficult the form of a thing we are told is its essence and primary substance forms are substantialalthough universals are not when a man makes a brazen sphere both the matter and the formalready existed and all that he does is to bring them together the man does not make the formany more than he makes the brass not everything has matter there are eternal things and thesehave no matter except those of them that are movable in space things increase in actuality byacquiring form matter without form is only a potentiality the view that forms are substances which exist independently of the matter in which they areexemplified seems to expose aristotle to his own arguments against platonic ideas a form isintended by him to be something quite different from a universal but it has many of the samecharacteristics form is we are told more real than matter this is reminiscent of the sole realityof the ideas the change that aristotle makes in platos metaphysic is it would seem less thanhe represents it as being this view is taken by zeller who on the question of matter and formsays the final explanation of aristotles want of clearness on this subject is however to be found inthe fact that he had only half emancipated himself as we shall see from platos tendency tohypostatise ideas the forms had for him as the ideas had for plato a metaphysical existenceof their own as conditioning all individual things and keenly as he followed the growth ofideas out of experience it is none the less true that these ideas especially at the point wherethey are farthest removed from experience and immediate perception are metamorphosed in theend from a logical product of human thought into an immediate presentment of a supersensibleworld and the object in that sense of an intellectual intuition i do not see how aristotle could have found a reply to this criticism the only answer that i can imagine would be one that maintained that no two things could havethe same form if a man makes two brass spheres each has its ownspecial  aristotle vol i p  sphericity which is substantial and particular an instance of the universal sphericity but notidentical with it i do not think the language of the passages i quoted would readily support thisinterpretation and it would be open to the objection that the particular sphericity would on aristotles view be unknowable whereas it is of the essence of his metaphysics that as therecomes to be more of form and less of matter things become gradually more knowable this isonly consistent with the rest of his views if the form can be embodied in many particular things ifhe were to say that there are as many forms that are instances of sphericity as there are sphericalthings he would have to make very radical alterations in his philosophy for instance his viewthat a form is identical with its essence is incompatible with the above suggested escape the doctrine of matter and form in aristotle is connected with the distinction of potentiality andactuality bare matter is conceived as a potentiality of form all change is what we should callevolution in the sense that after the change the thing in question has more form than before that which has more form is considered to be more actual god is pure form and pure actualityin him therefore there can be no change it will be seen that this doctrine is optimistic andteleological the universe and everything in it is developing towards something continually betterthan what went before the concept of potentiality is convenient in some connections provided it is so used that we cantranslate our statements into a form in which the concept is absent a block of marble is apotential statue means from a block of marble by suitable acts a statue is produced but whenpotentiality is used as a fundamental and irreducible concept it always conceals confusion ofthought aristotles use of it is one of the bad points in his system aristotles theology is interesting and closely connected with the rest of his metaphysicsindeedtheology is one of his names for what we call metaphysics there are he says three kinds of substances those that are sensible and perishable those that aresensible but not perishable and those that are neither sensible nor perishable the first classincludes plants and animals the second includes the heavenly bodies which aristotle

known from the hittite tablets found at boghaz keui to have had a large organized empire in thefourteenth century bc the mycenaean civilization which had been weakened by the warfare ofthe ionians and achaeans was practically destroyed by the dorians the last greek invaders whereas previous invaders had largely adopted the minoan religion the dorians retained theoriginal indo european religion of their ancestors the religion of mycenaean times howeverlingered on especially in the lower classes and the religion of classical greece was a blend of thetwo although the above account seems probable it must be remembered that we do not know whetherthe mycenaeans were greeks or not what we do know is that their civilization decayed thatabout the time when it ended iron superseded bronze and that for some time sea supremacypassed to the phoenicians both during the later part of the mycenaean age and after its end some of the invaders settleddown and became agriculturists while some pushed on first into the islands and asia minor theninto sicily and southern italy where they founded cities that lived by maritime commerce it wasin these maritime cities that the greeks first made qualitatively new contributions to civilizationthe supremacy of athens came later and was equally associated when it came with naval power the mainland of greece is mountainous and largely infertile but there are many fertile valleyswith easy access to the sea but cut off by the mountains from easy land communication with eachother in these valleys little separate communities grew up living by agriculture and centeringround a town generally close to the sea in such circumstances it was natural that as soon as thepopulation of any community grew too great for its internal resources those who could not live onthe land should take to seafaring the cities of the mainland founded colonies often in placeswhere it was much easier to find subsistence than it had been at home thus in the earliesthistorical period the greeks of asia minor sicily and italy were much richer than those of the greek mainland the social system was very different in different parts of greece in sparta a small aristocracysubsisted on the labour of oppressed serfs of a different race in the poorer agricultural regions thepopulation consisted mainly of farmers cultivating their own land with the help of their families but where commerce and industry flourished the free citizens grew rich by theemployment of slavesmale in the mines female in the textile industry these slaves were in ionia of the surrounding barbarian population and were as a rule first acquired in war withincreasing wealth went increasing isolation of respectable women who in later times had littlepart in the civilized aspects of greek life except in sparta there was a very general development first from monarchy to aristocracy then to analternation of tyranny and democracy the kings were not absolute like those of egypt and babylonia they were advised by a council of elders and could not transgress custom withimpunity tyranny did not mean necessarily bad government but only the rule of a manwhose claim to power was not hereditary democracy meant government by all the citizensamong whom slaves and women were not included the early tyrants like the medici acquiredtheir power through being the richest members of their respective plutocracies often the sourceof their wealth was the ownership of gold and silver mines made the more profitable by thenew institution of coinage which came from the kingdom of lydia adjacent to ionia coinage seems to have been invented shortly before bc one of the most important results to the greeks of commerce or piracyat first the two arescarcely distinctwas the acquisition of the art of writing although writing had existed forthousands of years in egypt and babylonia and the minoan cretans had a script there is no conclusive evidence that the greeks knew how to write until aboutthe tenth century bc they learnt the art from the phoenicians who like the other inhabitantsof syria were exposed to both egyptian and babylonian influences and who held thesupremacy in maritime commerce until the rise of the greek cities of ionia italy and sicily inthe fourteenth century writing to ikhnaton syrians still used the babylonian cuneiform but hiram of tyre used the phoenician alphabet whichprobably developed out of the egyptian script the egyptians used at first a pure picturewriting gradually the pictures much conventionalized came to represent  see p n ure the origin of tyranny 
to understand aristotles doctrine of the soul we must remember that the soul is the form of thebody and that spatial shape is one kind of form what is there in common is hte conferring ofunity upon a certain amount of matter the part of a block of marble which afterwards becomes astatue is as yet not sparated from the rest of the marble it is not yet a thing and has not yet anyunity after the sculptor has made the statue it has unity which it derives from its shape now theesential feature of the soul in virtue of which it is the form of the body is that it makes the bodyan organic whole having purposes as a unit a single organ has purposes lying outside itself theeye in isolation cannot see thus many things can be said in which an animal or plant as a wholeis the subject which cannot be said about any part of it it is in this sense that organization orform confers substantiality that which confers substantiality upon a plant or animal is what aristotle calls it soul but mind is something different less intimately bound up with thebody perhaps it is a part of the soul but it is possessed by only a small minority of living beings mind as speculation cannot be the cause of movement for it never thinks about what ispracticable and never says what is to be avoided or what pursued a similar doctrine though with a slight change of terminology is set forth in the nicomachean ethics there is in the soul one element that is rational and that is irrational the irrational part istwofold the vegetative which is found in everything living even in plants and the appetitivewhich exists in all animals the life of the rational soul consists in contemplation whichis the completehappiness of man though not fully attainable such a life would be too high forman for it is not in so far as he is man that he will live so but in so far as something divine ispresent in him and by so much as this is superior to our composite nature is its activity superior tothat which is the exercise of the other kind of virtue if reason is divine thenin comparison with man the life in accordance with it is divine in comparison in human life butwe must not follow those who advise us being men to think of human things and being mortalof mortal things but must so far as we can make ourselves immortal and strain every nerve otlive in accordance with the best thing in us for even if it be small in bulk much more does it in power and worth surpass everything it seems from these passages that individualitywhat distinguishes one man from anotherisconnected with the body and the irrational soul while the rational soul or mind is divine andimpersonal one man likes oysters and another likes pineapples this distinguishes between them but when they think about the multiplication table provided they think correctly there is nodifference between them the irrational separates us the rational unites us thus the immortalityof mind or reason is not a personal immortality of separate men but a share in personalimmortality in the sense in which it was taught by plato and afterwards by christianity hebelieved only that in so far as men are rational they partake of the divine which is immortal it isopen to man to increase the element of the divine in his nature and to do so is the highest virtue but if he succeeded completely he would have ceased to exist as a separate person this isperhaps not the only possible interpretation of aristotles words but i think it is the most natural chapter xx aristotles ethics in the corpus of aristotles works three treatises on ethics have a place but tow of these are nowgenerally held to be by disciples the third the nicomachean ethics remains for the most partunquestioned as to authenticity but even in this book there is a portion which is held by many to have been incorporated from one of the works of disciples i shallhowever ignore this controversial question and treat the book as a whole and as aristotles the views of aristotle on ethics represent in the main the prevailing opinions of educated andexperienced men of his day they are not like platos impregnated with mystical religion nor dothey 
much more does it in power and worth surpass everything it seems from these passages that individualitywhat distinguishes one man from anotherisconnected with the body and the irrational soul while the rational soul or mind is divine andimpersonal one man likes oysters and another likes pineapples this distinguishes between them but when they think about the multiplication table provided they think correctly there is nodifference between them the irrational separates us the rational unites us thus the immortalityof mind or reason is not a personal immortality of separate men but a share in personalimmortality in the sense in which it was taught by plato and afterwards by christianity hebelieved only that in so far as men are rational they partake of the divine which is immortal it isopen to man to increase the element of the divine in his nature and to do so is the highest virtue but if he succeeded completely he would have ceased to exist as a separate person this isperhaps not the only possible interpretation of aristotles words but i think it is the most natural chapter xx aristotles ethics in the corpus of aristotles works three treatises on ethics have a place but tow of these are nowgenerally held to be by disciples the third the nicomachean ethics remains for the most partunquestioned as to authenticity but even in this book there is a portion which is held by many to have been incorporated from one of the works of disciples i shallhowever ignore this controversial question and treat the book as a whole and as aristotles the views of aristotle on ethics represent in the main the prevailing opinions of educated andexperienced men of his day they are not like platos impregnated with mystical religion nor dothey countenance such unorthodox theories as are to be found in the republic concerning property andthe family those who neither fall below nor rise above the level of decent wellbehaved citizenswill find in the ethics a systematic account of the principles by which they hold that their conductshold be regulated those who demand anything more will be disappointed the book appeals tothe respectable middleaged and has been used by them especially since the seveteenth centuryto repress the ardours and enthusiasms of the young but to a man with any depth of feeling itcannot but be repulsive the good we are told is happiness which is an activity of the soul aristotle says that plato wasright in dividing the soul into tow parts one rational the other irrational the irrational part itselfhe divides into the vegetative and the appetitive the appetitive part may be in some degree rational when the goods that it seeks aresuch as reason approves of this is essential to the account of virtue for reason alone in aristotleis purely contemplative and does not without the help of appetite lead to any practical activity there are tow kinds of virtues intellectual and moral corresponding to the two parts of the soul intellectual virtues result from teaching moral virtues from habit it is the business of thelegislator to make the citizens good by forming good habits we become just by performing justacts and similarly as regards other virtues by being compelled to acquire good habits we shall intime aristotle thinks come to find pleasure in performing good actions one is reminded of hamlets speech to his mother assume a virtue if you have it not that monster custom who all sense doth eat of habits devilis angel yet in this that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery that aptly is put on we now come to the famous doctrine of the golden mean every virtue is a mean between twoextremes each of which is a vice this is proved by an examination of the various virtues courage is a mean between cowardice and rashness liberality between prodigality and 
countenance such unorthodox theories as are to be found in the republic concerning property andthe family those who neither fall below nor rise above the level of decent wellbehaved citizenswill find in the ethics a systematic account of the principles by which they hold that their conductshold be regulated those who demand anything more will be disappointed the book appeals tothe respectable middleaged and has been used by them especially since the seveteenth centuryto repress the ardours and enthusiasms of the young but to a man with any depth of feeling itcannot but be repulsive the good we are told is happiness which is an activity of the soul aristotle says that plato wasright in dividing the soul into tow parts one rational the other irrational the irrational part itselfhe divides into the vegetative and the appetitive the appetitive part may be in some degree rational when the goods that it seeks aresuch as reason approves of this is essential to the account of virtue for reason alone in aristotleis purely contemplative and does not without the help of appetite lead to any practical activity there are tow kinds of virtues intellectual and moral corresponding to the two parts of the soul intellectual virtues result from teaching moral virtues from habit it is the business of thelegislator to make the citizens good by forming good habits we become just by performing justacts and similarly as regards other virtues by being compelled to acquire good habits we shall intime aristotle thinks come to find pleasure in performing good actions one is reminded of hamlets speech to his mother assume a virtue if you have it not that monster custom who all sense doth eat of habits devilis angel yet in this that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery that aptly is put on we now come to the famous doctrine of the golden mean every virtue is a mean between twoextremes each of which is a vice this is proved by an examination of the various virtues courage is a mean between cowardice and rashness liberality between prodigality and meanness proper pride between vanity and humility ready wit between buffoonery andboorishness modesty between bashfulness and shamelessness some virtues do not seem to fitinto this scheme for instance truthfulness aristotle says that this is a mean between boastfulnessand mockmodesty but this only applies to truthfulness about oneself i do not see howtruthfulness in any wider sense can be fitted into the scheme there was once a mayor who hadadopted aristotles doctrine at the end of his term of office he made a speech saying that he hadendeavoured to steer the narrow line between partiality on the one hand and impartiality on theother the view of truthfulness as a mean seems scarcely less absurd aristotles opinions on moral questions are always such as were conventional in his day onesome points they differ from those of our time chiefly where some form of aristocracy comes in we think that human beings at least in ethical theory all have equal rights and that justiceinvolves equality aristotle thinks that justice involves not equality but right proportion which isonly sometimes equality the justice of a master or a father is different thing from that of a citizen for a son or slave ispropertya and there can be no injustice to ones own property as regards slaveshowever there is slight modification of this doctrine in connection with the question whether it ispossible for a man to be a friend of his slave there is nothing in common between the towparties the slave is a living tool qua slave then one cannot be friends with him but qua manone can for there seems to be some justice between any man and any other who can share in asystem of law or be a party to an agreement therefore can also be friendship with him in so far ashe is a man a father can repudiate his son if he is wicked but a son cannot repudiate his father because heowes him more than he can possibly repay especially existence in unequal relations it isright since everybody should be loved in proportion to his worth that the inferior should love thesuperior more than the superior love the inferior wives children subjects should have more lovefor husbands parents and monarchs than the latter have for them in a good marriage the manrules in accordance with his worth and in those matters in which a man should rule but thematters that 
meanness proper pride between vanity and humility ready wit between buffoonery andboorishness modesty between bashfulness and shamelessness some virtues do not seem to fitinto this scheme for instance truthfulness aristotle says that this is a mean between boastfulnessand mockmodesty but this only applies to truthfulness about oneself i do not see howtruthfulness in any wider sense can be fitted into the scheme there was once a mayor who hadadopted aristotles doctrine at the end of his term of office he made a speech saying that he hadendeavoured to steer the narrow line between partiality on the one hand and impartiality on theother the view of truthfulness as a mean seems scarcely less absurd aristotles opinions on moral questions are always such as were conventional in his day onesome points they differ from those of our time chiefly where some form of aristocracy comes in we think that human beings at least in ethical theory all have equal rights and that justiceinvolves equality aristotle thinks that justice involves not equality but right proportion which isonly sometimes equality the justice of a master or a father is different thing from that of a citizen for a son or slave ispropertya and there can be no injustice to ones own property as regards slaveshowever there is slight modification of this doctrine in connection with the question whether it ispossible for a man to be a friend of his slave there is nothing in common between the towparties the slave is a living tool qua slave then one cannot be friends with him but qua manone can for there seems to be some justice between any man and any other who can share in asystem of law or be a party to an agreement therefore can also be friendship with him in so far ashe is a man a father can repudiate his son if he is wicked but a son cannot repudiate his father because heowes him more than he can possibly repay especially existence in unequal relations it isright since everybody should be loved in proportion to his worth that the inferior should love thesuperior more than the superior love the inferior wives children subjects should have more lovefor husbands parents and monarchs than the latter have for them in a good marriage the manrules in accordance with his worth and in those matters in which a man should rule but thematters that befit a woman he hands over to her he should not rule in her province still lessshould she rule in his as sometimes happens when she is an heiress the best individual as conceived by aristotle is avery different person from the christiansaint he should have proper pride and not underestimate his own merits he should despisewhoever deserves to de despised the description of the proud or magnanimous man is very interesting as showing the difference between pagan and christian ethics and the sensein which nietzsche was justified in regarding christianity as a slavemorality the magnanimous man sicne he deserves most must be good in the highest degree for thebetter man always deserves more and the best man most therefore the truly magnanimousman must be good and greatness in every virtue would seem to be characteristic of themagnanimous man and it would be most unbecoming for the magnanimous man to fly fromdanger swinging his arms by his sides or to wrong another for to what end should he dodisgraceful acts he to whom nothing is great magnanimity then seems to be a sort ofcrown of the virtues for it makes them greater and it is not found without them therefore it ishard to be truly magnanimous for it is impossible without nobility and goodness of character itis chiefly with honours and dishonours then that the magnanimous man is concerned and athonours that are great and conferred by good men he will be moderately pleased thinking thathe is coming by his own or even less than hi own for there can be no honour that is worthy ofperfect virtue yet he will at any rate accept it since they have nothing greater to bestow on himbut honour from casual people and on trifling grounds he will utterly depise since it is not thisthat he deserves and dishonour too since in his case it cannot be just power and wealth aredesirable for the sake of honour and to him for whom even honour is a little thing the othersmust be so too hence magnanimous men are thought to be disdainful the magnanimousman does not run into trifling dangers but he will face great dangers and when he is indanger he  the greek word means leterally greatsouled and is usually translated magnanimousbut the oxford translation renders it proud neither word in its modern usage quiteexpresses aristotles meaning but i prefer magnanimous and have therefore substitutedit for proud in the above quotation from the oxford translation 
befit a woman he hands over to her he should not rule in her province still lessshould she rule in his as sometimes happens when she is an heiress the best individual as conceived by aristotle is avery different person from the christiansaint he should have proper pride and not underestimate his own merits he should despisewhoever deserves to de despised the description of the proud or magnanimous man is very interesting as showing the difference between pagan and christian ethics and the sensein which nietzsche was justified in regarding christianity as a slavemorality the magnanimous man sicne he deserves most must be good in the highest degree for thebetter man always deserves more and the best man most therefore the truly magnanimousman must be good and greatness in every virtue would seem to be characteristic of themagnanimous man and it would be most unbecoming for the magnanimous man to fly fromdanger swinging his arms by his sides or to wrong another for to what end should he dodisgraceful acts he to whom nothing is great magnanimity then seems to be a sort ofcrown of the virtues for it makes them greater and it is not found without them therefore it ishard to be truly magnanimous for it is impossible without nobility and goodness of character itis chiefly with honours and dishonours then that the magnanimous man is concerned and athonours that are great and conferred by good men he will be moderately pleased thinking thathe is coming by his own or even less than hi own for there can be no honour that is worthy ofperfect virtue yet he will at any rate accept it since they have nothing greater to bestow on himbut honour from casual people and on trifling grounds he will utterly depise since it is not thisthat he deserves and dishonour too since in his case it cannot be just power and wealth aredesirable for the sake of honour and to him for whom even honour is a little thing the othersmust be so too hence magnanimous men are thought to be disdainful the magnanimousman does not run into trifling dangers but he will face great dangers and when he is indanger he  the greek word means leterally greatsouled and is usually translated magnanimousbut the oxford translation renders it proud neither word in its modern usage quiteexpresses aristotles meaning but i prefer magnanimous and have therefore substitutedit for proud in the above quotation from the oxford translation is unsparing of his life knowing that there are conditions on which life is not worth having andhe is the sort of man to confer benefits but he is ashamed of receiving them for the one is themark of a superior the other of an inferior and he is apt to confer greater benefits in return forthus the original benefactor besides being repaid will incur a debt to himit is the mark ot themagnanimous man to ask for nothing or scarcely anything but to give help readily and to bedignified towards people who enjoy a high position but unassuming towards those of the middleclass for it is a difficult and lofty thing to be superior to the former but easy to be so to the latterand a lofty bearing ove the former is no mark of illbreeding but among humble people it is asvulgar as a display of strength against the weakhe must also be open in his hate and in his lovefor to conceal ones feelings ie to care less for truth than for what people think is a cowardsparthe is free of speech because he is contemptuous and he is given to telling the truth exceptwhen he speaks in irony to the vulgar nor is he given to admiration for to him nothing isgreat nor is he a gossip for he will speak neither about himself nor about another since hecares not to be praised nor for others to be blamed he is one who will possess beautiful andprofitless things rather than profitable and useful onesfurther a slow step is thought proper tothe magnanimous man a deep voice and a level utterancesuch then is the magnanimous manthe man who fall short of him is unduly humble and the man who goes beyond him is vanin one shudders to think what a vain man would be like whatever may be thought of the magnanimous man one thing is clear there cannot be very manyof him in a community i do not mean merely in the general sense in which there are not likely tobe many virtuous men on the ground that virtue is difficult what i mean is that the virtues of themagnanimous man largely depend upon his having an exceptional social position aristotleconsiders ethics a branch of politics and it is not surprising after his praise of pride to find thathe considers monarchy the best form of government and aristocracy the next best monarchs andaristocrats can be magnanimous but ordinary citizens would be laughable if they attempted tolive up to such a pattern this brings up a question which is half ethical half political can

we regard as morally satisfactory a community which by its essential constitution confines thebest things to a few and requires the majority to be content with the secondbest plato and aristotle say yes and nietzsche agrees with them stoics christians and democrats say no butthere are great differences in their ways of saying no stoics and early christians consider that thegreatest good is virtue and that external circumstances cannot prevent a man from being virtuousthere is therefore no need to seek a just social system since social injustice affects onlyunimportant matters the democrat on the contrary usually holds that at least so far as politicsare concerned the most important goods are power and property he cannot therefore acquiescein a social system which is unjust in these respects the stoic christian view requires a conception of virtue very different from aristotles since itmust hold that virtue is as possible for the slave as for his master christian ethics disapproves ofpride which aristotle thinks a virtue and praises humility which he thinks a vice theintellectual virtues which plato and aristotle value above all others have to be thrust out of thelist altogether in order that the poor and humble may be able to be as virtuous as any one else pope gregory the great solemnly reproved a bishop for teaching grammar the aristotelian view that the highest virtue is for the few is logivally connected with thesubordination of ethics to politics if the aim is the good community rather than the goodindividual it is possible that the good community may be one in which there is subordination inan orchestra the first violin is more important than the oboe though both are necessary for theexcellence of the whole it is impossible to organize an orchestra on the principle of giving to eachman what would be best for him as an isolated individual the same sort of thing applies to thegovernment of a large modern state however democratic a modern democracy unlike those ofantiquity confers great power upon certain chosen individuals presidents or prime ministersand must expect of them kinds of merit which are not expected of the ordinary citizen whenpeople are not thinking in terms of religion or political controversy they are likely to hold that agood president is more to be honoured than a good bricklayer in a democracy a president is notexpected to be quite like aristotles magnanimous man but still he is expected to be rather different from theaverage citizen and to have certain merits connnected with his station these peculiar meritswould perhaps not be considered ethical but that is because we use this adjective in anarrower sense than that in which it is used by aristotle as a result of christian dogma the distinction between moral and other merits has becomemuch sharper than it was in greek times it is a merit in a man to be a great poet or composer orpainter but not a moral merit we do not consider him the more virtuous for possessing suchaptitudes or the more likely to go to heaven moral merit is concerned solely with acts of willie with choosing rightly among possible courses of action i am not to blame for notcomposing an opera because i dont know how to do it the orthodox view is that wherevertwo courses of action are possible conscience tells me which is right and to choose the other issin virtue consists mainly in the avoidance of sin rather than in anything positive there is noreason to expect an educated man to be morally better than an uneducated man or a clever manthan a stupid man in this way a number of merits of great social importance are shut out fromthe realm of ethics the adjective unethical in modern usage has a much narrower range thanthe adjective undesirable it is undesirable to be feebleminded but not unethical many modern philosophers however have not accepted this view of ethics they have thoughtthat one should first define the good and then say that our actions ought top be such as tend torealize the good this point of view is more like that of aristotle who holds that happiness isthe good the highest happiness it is true is only open to the philosopher but to him that is noobjection to the theory ethical theories may be divided into two classes accroding as they regard virtue as an end or ameans aristotle on the whole takes the view that virtues are means to an end namelyhappiness the end then being what we wish for the means what we deliberate about andchoose actions concerning means most be according to choice and voluntary now the exerciseof the virtues is concerned with means but there is another sense of virtue in which itis included in the ends of action human good is activityof soul  it is true that aristotle also says this but as he means it the consequences are notso farreaching as in the christian interpretation 
like aristotles magnanimous man but still he is expected to be rather different from theaverage citizen and to have certain merits connnected with his station these peculiar meritswould perhaps not be considered ethical but that is because we use this adjective in anarrower sense than that in which it is used by aristotle as a result of christian dogma the distinction between moral and other merits has becomemuch sharper than it was in greek times it is a merit in a man to be a great poet or composer orpainter but not a moral merit we do not consider him the more virtuous for possessing suchaptitudes or the more likely to go to heaven moral merit is concerned solely with acts of willie with choosing rightly among possible courses of action i am not to blame for notcomposing an opera because i dont know how to do it the orthodox view is that wherevertwo courses of action are possible conscience tells me which is right and to choose the other issin virtue consists mainly in the avoidance of sin rather than in anything positive there is noreason to expect an educated man to be morally better than an uneducated man or a clever manthan a stupid man in this way a number of merits of great social importance are shut out fromthe realm of ethics the adjective unethical in modern usage has a much narrower range thanthe adjective undesirable it is undesirable to be feebleminded but not unethical many modern philosophers however have not accepted this view of ethics they have thoughtthat one should first define the good and then say that our actions ought top be such as tend torealize the good this point of view is more like that of aristotle who holds that happiness isthe good the highest happiness it is true is only open to the philosopher but to him that is noobjection to the theory ethical theories may be divided into two classes accroding as they regard virtue as an end or ameans aristotle on the whole takes the view that virtues are means to an end namelyhappiness the end then being what we wish for the means what we deliberate about andchoose actions concerning means most be according to choice and voluntary now the exerciseof the virtues is concerned with means but there is another sense of virtue in which itis included in the ends of action human good is activityof soul  it is true that aristotle also says this but as he means it the consequences are notso farreaching as in the christian interpretation in accordance with virtue in a complete life i think he would say that the intellectualvirtues are ends but the practical virtues are only means christian moralists hold that while theconsequences of virtuous actions are in general good they are not as good as the virtuos actionsthemselves which are to be valued on their own accountm and not on account of their effects onthe other hand those who consider pleasure the good regard virtues solely means any otherdefinition of the good except the definition as virtue will have the same consequence on thisquestion aristole as already said agrees mainly though not wholly and those who thinkthe firstbusiness of ethics is to define the good and that virtue is to be defined as a section tending toproducethe good the relation of ethics to politics raises another critical question of considerable inportance granted that the good at which right action should aim is the good of the whole community orultimately of the whole human race is this social good a sum of goods enjoyed by individuals oris it something belonging essentially to the whole not to the parts we may illustrate the problemby the analogy of the human body pleasures are largely associated with different parts of thebody but we consider them as belonging to a person as a whole we may enjoy a pleasant smellbut we know that the nose alone could not enjoy it some contend that in a closely organizedcommunity there are analogously excellences belonging to the whole but not to any part if theyare metaphysicians they may hold like hegel that whatever quality is good is an attribute of theuniverse as a whole but they will generally add that it is less mistaken to attribute good to a statethan to an individual logically the view may not be put as follows wh can attribute to a statevarious predicates that cannot be attributed to its separate members that it is populousmextensive powerful etc the view we are considering puts ethical predicates in this class andsays that they only derivatively belong to individuals a man who may belong tp a populous stateor to a good state but he they say is no more good than he is populous this view which hasbeen widely held by german philosophers is not aristotless except possibly in some degree inhis conception of justice a considerable part of the ethics is occupied with the discussion of friendship including allrelations that involve affection perfect 
in accordance with virtue in a complete life i think he would say that the intellectualvirtues are ends but the practical virtues are only means christian moralists hold that while theconsequences of virtuous actions are in general good they are not as good as the virtuos actionsthemselves which are to be valued on their own accountm and not on account of their effects onthe other hand those who consider pleasure the good regard virtues solely means any otherdefinition of the good except the definition as virtue will have the same consequence on thisquestion aristole as already said agrees mainly though not wholly and those who thinkthe firstbusiness of ethics is to define the good and that virtue is to be defined as a section tending toproducethe good the relation of ethics to politics raises another critical question of considerable inportance granted that the good at which right action should aim is the good of the whole community orultimately of the whole human race is this social good a sum of goods enjoyed by individuals oris it something belonging essentially to the whole not to the parts we may illustrate the problemby the analogy of the human body pleasures are largely associated with different parts of thebody but we consider them as belonging to a person as a whole we may enjoy a pleasant smellbut we know that the nose alone could not enjoy it some contend that in a closely organizedcommunity there are analogously excellences belonging to the whole but not to any part if theyare metaphysicians they may hold like hegel that whatever quality is good is an attribute of theuniverse as a whole but they will generally add that it is less mistaken to attribute good to a statethan to an individual logically the view may not be put as follows wh can attribute to a statevarious predicates that cannot be attributed to its separate members that it is populousmextensive powerful etc the view we are considering puts ethical predicates in this class andsays that they only derivatively belong to individuals a man who may belong tp a populous stateor to a good state but he they say is no more good than he is populous this view which hasbeen widely held by german philosophers is not aristotless except possibly in some degree inhis conception of justice a considerable part of the ethics is occupied with the discussion of friendship including allrelations that involve affection perfect friendship is only possible between the good and it is impossible to be friends with many people one should not be friends with a person of higher station than ones own unless he is also ofhigher virtue which will justify the respect shown to him we have seen that in unequal relationssuch as those of man and wife or father or son the superior should be the more loved it isimpossible to be friends with god because he cannot love us aristotle discusses whether a mancan be a friend to himself and decides that this is only possible if he is a good man wicked menhe asserts often hate themselves the good man should love himself but nobly friendsare a comfort in misfortune but one should not make them unhappy by seeking their sympathy asis done by women and womanish men it is not only in misfortune that friends aredesirable for the happy man needs friends with whom to share his happiness no one wouldchoose the whole world on condition of being alone since man is a political creature and onewhose nature is to live with others all that is said about friendship is sensible but thereis not a word that rises above common sense aristotle again shows his good sense in the discussion of pleasure which plato had regardedsomewhat ascetically pleasure as aristotle uses the word is distinct from happiness thoughthere can be no happiness without pleasure there are he says three views of pleasure that itis never good that some pleasure is good but most is bad that pleasure is good but notthe best he rejects the first of these on the ground that pain is certainly bad and thereforepleasure must be good he says very justly that it is nonsense to say a man can be happy on therack some degree of external good fortune is necessary for happiness he also disposes of theview that all pleasures are bodily all things have something divine and therefore some capacityfor higher pleasures good men have pleasure unless they are unfortunate and god always enjoysa single and simple pleasure there is another discussion of pleasure in a later part of the book which is not wholly consistentwith the above here it is argued that there are bad pleasures which however are not pleasures togood people that perhaps differ in kind and that pleasures are good or badaccording as they are connected with good or bad activities there are things that arevalued more 
friendship is only possible between the good and it is impossible to be friends with many people one should not be friends with a person of higher station than ones own unless he is also ofhigher virtue which will justify the respect shown to him we have seen that in unequal relationssuch as those of man and wife or father or son the superior should be the more loved it isimpossible to be friends with god because he cannot love us aristotle discusses whether a mancan be a friend to himself and decides that this is only possible if he is a good man wicked menhe asserts often hate themselves the good man should love himself but nobly friendsare a comfort in misfortune but one should not make them unhappy by seeking their sympathy asis done by women and womanish men it is not only in misfortune that friends aredesirable for the happy man needs friends with whom to share his happiness no one wouldchoose the whole world on condition of being alone since man is a political creature and onewhose nature is to live with others all that is said about friendship is sensible but thereis not a word that rises above common sense aristotle again shows his good sense in the discussion of pleasure which plato had regardedsomewhat ascetically pleasure as aristotle uses the word is distinct from happiness thoughthere can be no happiness without pleasure there are he says three views of pleasure that itis never good that some pleasure is good but most is bad that pleasure is good but notthe best he rejects the first of these on the ground that pain is certainly bad and thereforepleasure must be good he says very justly that it is nonsense to say a man can be happy on therack some degree of external good fortune is necessary for happiness he also disposes of theview that all pleasures are bodily all things have something divine and therefore some capacityfor higher pleasures good men have pleasure unless they are unfortunate and god always enjoysa single and simple pleasure there is another discussion of pleasure in a later part of the book which is not wholly consistentwith the above here it is argued that there are bad pleasures which however are not pleasures togood people that perhaps differ in kind and that pleasures are good or badaccording as they are connected with good or bad activities there are things that arevalued more than pleasure no one would be content to go through life with a childs intellect even if it werepleasant to do so each animal has its proper pleasure and the proper pleasure of man isconnected with reason this leads on to the only doctrine in the book which is not mere common sense happiness lies invirtuous activity and perfect happiness lies in the best activity which is contemplative contemplation is preferable to war or politics or any other practical career because it allowsleisure and leisure is essential to happiness practical virtue brings only a secondary kind ofhappiness the supreme happiness is in the exercise of reason for reason more than anything elseis man man cannot be wholly contemplative but in so far as he is so he shares in the divine lifethe activity of god which surpasses all others in blessedness must be contemplative of allhuman beings the philosopher is the most godlike in his activity and therefore the happiest andbest he who exercises his reason and cultivates it seems to be both in the best state of mind and mostdear to the gods for if the gods have any care for human affairs as they are thought to have itwould be reasonable both that they should delight in that which was best and most akin to them and that they should reward those who love and honour this most as caring for thethings that are dear to them and acting both rightly and nobly and that all these attributes belongmost of all to the philosopher is manifest he therefore is the dearest to the gods and he who isthat will presumably be also the happiest so that in this way too the philosopher will more thanany other be happy this passage is virtually the peroration of the ethics the few paragraphs that follow are concernedwith the transition to politics let us now try to decide what we are to think of the merits anddemerits of the ethics unlike many other subjects treated by greek philosophers ethics has notmade any definite advances in the sense of ascertained discoveries nothing in ethics is known ina scientific sense there is therefore no reason why an ancient treatise on it should be in anyrespect inferior to a modern one when aristotle talks about astronomy we can say definitely thathe is wrong but when he talks about ethics we cannot say in the same sense either that he iswrong or that he is right broadly speaking there are three

questions that we can ask about the ethics of aristotle or of any other philosopher is itinternally selfconsistent is it consistent with the remainder of the authors views does itgive answers to ethical problems that are consonant to our own ethical feelings if the answer toeither the first or second question is in the negative the philosopher in question has been guilty ofsome intellectual error but if the answer to the third question is in the negative we have no rightto say that he is mistaken we have only the right to say that we do not like him let us examine these three questions in turn as regards the ethical theory set forth in the nicomachean ethics on the whole the book is selfconsistent except in a few not very important respects thedoctrine that the good is happiness and that happiness consists in successful activity is wellworked out the doctrine that every virtue is a mean between two extremes though veryingeniously developed is less successful since it does not apply to intellectual contemplationwhich we are told is the best of all activities it can however be maintained that the doctrine ofthe mean is only intended to apply to the practical virtues not to those of the intellect perhaps totake another point the position of the legislator is somewhat ambiguous he is to cause childrenand young people to acquire the habit of performing good actions which will in the end leadthem to find pleasure in virtue and to act virtuously without the need of legal compulsion it isobvious that the legislator might equally well cause the young to acquire bad habits if this is to beavoided he must have all the wisdom of a platonic guardian and if it is not avoided the argumentthat a virtuous life is pleasant will fail this problem however belongs perhaps more to politicsthan to ethics aristotles ethics is at all points consistent with his metaphysics indeed his metaphysicaltheories are themselves the expression of an ethical optimism he believes in the scientificimportance of final causes and this implies the belief that purpose governs the course ofdevelopment in the universe he thinks that changes are in the main such as embody an increaseof organization or form and at bottom virtuous actions are those that favour this tendency it istrue that a great deal of his practical ethics is not particularly philosophical but merely the resultof observation of human affairs but this part of his doctrine though it may be independent of his metaphysics is not inconsistentwith it when we come to compare aristotles ethical tastes with our own we find in the first placeas already noted an acceptance of inequality which is repugnant to much modern sentiment notonly is there no objection to slavery or to the superiority of husbands and fathers over wives andchildren but it is held that what is best is essentially only for the fewproud men andphilosophers most men it would seem to follow are mainly means for the production of a fewrulers and sages kant maintained that every human being is an end in himself and this may betaken as an expression of the view introduced by christianity there is however a logicaldifficulty in kants view since it gives no means of reaching a decision when two mens interestsclash if each is an end in himself how are we to arrive at a principle for determining which shallgive way such a principle must have to do with the community rather than with the individual inthe broadest sense of the word it will have to be a principle of justice bentham and theutilitarians interpret justice as equality when two mens interests clash the right course is thatwhich produces the greatest total of happiness regardless of which of the two enjoys it or how itis shared among them if more is given to the better man than to the worse that is because in thelong run the general happiness is increased by rewarding virtue and punishing vice not becauseof an ultimate ethical doctrine that the good deserve more than the bad justice in this viewconsists in considering only the amount of happiness involved without favour to one individual orclass as against another greek philosophers including plato and aristotle had a differentconception of justice and it is one which is still widely prevalent they thoughtoriginally ongrounds derived from religionthat each thing or person had its or his proper sphere to overstepwhich is unjust some men in virtue of their character and aptitudes have a wider sphere thanothers and there is no injustice if they enjoy a greater share of happiness this view is taken forgranted in aristotle but its basis in primitive religion which is evident in the earliestphilosophers is no longer apparent in his writings there is in aristotle an almost complete absence of what may be called benevolence orphilanthropy the sufferings of mankind in so 
but this part of his doctrine though it may be independent of his metaphysics is not inconsistentwith it when we come to compare aristotles ethical tastes with our own we find in the first placeas already noted an acceptance of inequality which is repugnant to much modern sentiment notonly is there no objection to slavery or to the superiority of husbands and fathers over wives andchildren but it is held that what is best is essentially only for the fewproud men andphilosophers most men it would seem to follow are mainly means for the production of a fewrulers and sages kant maintained that every human being is an end in himself and this may betaken as an expression of the view introduced by christianity there is however a logicaldifficulty in kants view since it gives no means of reaching a decision when two mens interestsclash if each is an end in himself how are we to arrive at a principle for determining which shallgive way such a principle must have to do with the community rather than with the individual inthe broadest sense of the word it will have to be a principle of justice bentham and theutilitarians interpret justice as equality when two mens interests clash the right course is thatwhich produces the greatest total of happiness regardless of which of the two enjoys it or how itis shared among them if more is given to the better man than to the worse that is because in thelong run the general happiness is increased by rewarding virtue and punishing vice not becauseof an ultimate ethical doctrine that the good deserve more than the bad justice in this viewconsists in considering only the amount of happiness involved without favour to one individual orclass as against another greek philosophers including plato and aristotle had a differentconception of justice and it is one which is still widely prevalent they thoughtoriginally ongrounds derived from religionthat each thing or person had its or his proper sphere to overstepwhich is unjust some men in virtue of their character and aptitudes have a wider sphere thanothers and there is no injustice if they enjoy a greater share of happiness this view is taken forgranted in aristotle but its basis in primitive religion which is evident in the earliestphilosophers is no longer apparent in his writings there is in aristotle an almost complete absence of what may be called benevolence orphilanthropy the sufferings of mankind in so far as he is aware of them do not move him emotionally he holds them intellectually to be anevil but there is no evidence that they cause him unhappiness except when the sufferers happen tobe his friends more generally there is an emotional poverty in the ethics which is not found in the earlierphilosophers there is something unduly smug and comfortable about aristotles speculations onhuman affairs everything that makes men feel a passionate interest in each other seems to beforgotten even his account of friendship is tepid he shows no sign of having had any of thoseexperiences which make it difficult to preserve sanity all the more profound aspects of the morallife are apparently unknown to him he leaves out one may say the whole sphere of humanexperience with which religion is concerned what he has to say is what will be useful tocomfortable men of weak passions but he has nothing to say to those who are possessed by a godor a devil or whom outward misfortune drives to despair for these reasons in my judgement his ethics in spite of its fame is lacking in intrinsic importance chapter xxi aristotles politics aristotles politics is both interesting and importantteresting as showing the commonprejudices of educated greeks in his time and important as a source of many principles whichremained influential until the end of the middle ages i do not think there is much in it that couldbe of any practical use to a statesman of the present day but there is a great deal that throws lighton the conflicts of parties in different parts of the hellenic world there is not very muchawareness of methods of government in non hellenic states there are it is true allusions to egypt babylon persia and carthage but except in the case of carthage they are somewhatperfunctory there is no mention of alexander and

interest was essential consequently first calvin and then other protestant divines sanctionedinterest at last the catholic church was compelled to follow suit because the old prohibitionsdid not suit the modern world philosophers whose incomes are derived from the investments ofuniversities have favoured interest ever since they ceased to be ecclesiastics and thereforeconnected with landowning at every stage there has been a wealth of theoretical argument tosupport the economically convenient opinion platos utopia is criticized by aristotle on various grounds there is first the very interestingcomment that it gives too much unity to the state and would make it into an individual nextcomes the kind of argument against the proposed abolition of the family that naturally occurs toevery reader plato thinks that by merely giving the title of son to all who are of an age thatmakes their sonship possible a man will acquire towards the whole multitude the sentiments thatmen have at present towards their actual sons and correlatively as regards the title fatheraristotle on the contrary says that what is common to the greatest number receives the least careand that if sons are common to many fathers they will be neglected in common it is better tobe a cousin in reality than a son in platos sense platos plan would make love watery thenthere is a curious argument that since abstinence from adultery is a virtue it would be a pity tohave a social system which abolishes this virtue and the correlative vice then we areasked if women are common who will manage the house i wrote an essay once called architecture and the social system in which i pointed out that all who combine communismwith abolition of the family also advocate communal houses for large numbers with communalkitchens diningrooms and nurseries this system may be described as monasteries withoutcelibacy it is essential to the carrying out of platos plans but it is certainly not more impossiblethan many other things that he recommends platos communism annoys aristotle it would lead he says to anger against lazy people and tothe sort of quarrels that are common between fellowtravellers it is better if each minds his ownbusiness property should be private but people should be so trained in benevolence as to allowthe use of it to be largely common benevolence and generosity are virtues and without privateproperty they are impossible finally we are told that if platos plans were good someone would havethought of them sooner i do not agree with plato but if anything could make me do so itwould be aristotles arguments against him as we have seen in connection with slavery aristotle is no believer in equality grantedhowever the subjection of slaves and women it still remains a question whether all citizensshould be politically equal some men he says think this desirable on the ground that allrevolutions turn on the regulation of property he rejects this argument maintaining that thegreatest crimes are due to excess rather than want no man becomes a tyrant in order to avoidfeeling the cold a government is good when it aims at the good of the whole community bad when it cares onlyfor itself there are three kinds of government that are good monarchy aristocracy andconstitutional government there are three that are bad tyranny oligarchy anddemocracy there are also many mixed intermediate forms it will be observed that the goodand bad governments are defined by the ethical qualities of the holders of power not by theform of the constitution this however is only partly true an aristocracy is a rule of men ofvirtue an oligarchy is a rule of the rich and aristotle does not consider virtue and wealthstrictly synonymous what he holds in accordance with the doctrine of the golden mean is thata moderate competence is most likely to be associated with virtue mankind do not acquire orpreserve virtue by the help of external goods but external goods by the help of virtue andhappiness whether consisting in pleasure or virtue or both is more often found with those whoare most highly cultivated in their mind and in their character and have only a moderate shareof external goods than among those who possess external goods to a useless extent but aredeficient in higher qualities there is therefore a difference between the rule ofthe best and of the richest since the best are likely to have onlymoderate fortunes there is also a difference between democracy  cf the noodles oration in sydney smith if the proposal be sound would the saxonhave passed it by would the dine have ignored it would it have escaped the wisdom ofthe norman

and polity in addition to the ethical difference in the government for what aristotle calls polityretains some oligarchic elements but between monarchy and tyranny the only differenceis ethical he is emphatic in distinguishing oligarchy and democracy by the economic status of the governingparty there is oligarchy when the rich govern without consideration for the poor democracy whenpower is in the hands of the needy and they disregard the interest of the rich monarchy is better than aristocracy aristocracy is better than polity but the corruption of the bestis worst therefore tyranny is worse than oligarchy and oligarchy than democracy in this way aristotle arrives at a qualified defence of democracy for most actual governments are bad andtherefore among actual governments democracies tend to be best the greek conception of democracy was in many ways more extreme than ours for instance aristotle says that to elect magistrates is oligarchic while it is democratic to appoint them by lot in extreme democracies the assembly of the citizens was above the law and decided eachquestion independently the athenian lawcourts were composed of a large number of citizenschosen by lot unaided by any jurist they were of course liable to be swayed by eloquence orparty passion when democracy is criticized it must be understood that this sort of thing is meant there is a long discussion of causes of revolution in greece revolutions were as frequent asformerly in latin america and therefore aristotle had a copious experience from which to drawinferences the main cause was the conflict of oligarchs and democrats democracy aristotlesays arises from the belief that men who are equally free should be equal in all respectsoligarchy from the fact that men who are superior in some respect claim too much both have akind of justice but not the best kind therefore both parties whenever their share in thegovernment does not accord with their preconceived ideas stir up revolution democratic governments are less liable to revolutions than oligarchies because oligarchs may fallout with each other the oligarchs seem to have been vigorous fellows in some cities we are toldthey swore an oath i will be an enemy to the people and will devise all the harm against them which i can nowadaysreactionaries are not so frank the three things needed to prevent revolution are government propaganda in education respectfor law even in small things and justice in law and administration ie equality according toproportion and for every man to enjoy his own aristotle never seems tohave realized the difficulty of equality according to proportion if this is to be true justice theproportion must be of virtue now virtue is difficult to measure and is a matter of partycontroversy in political practice therefore virtue tends to be measured by income the distinctionbetween aristocracy and oligarchy which aristotle attempts to make is only possible where thereis a very wellestablished hereditary nobility even then as soon as there exists a large class ofrich men who are not noble they have to be admitted to power for fear of their making arevolution hereditary aristocracies cannot long retain their power except where land is almost theonly source of wealth all social inequality in the long run is inequality of income that is part ofthe argument for democracy that the attempt to have a proportionate justice based on any meritother than wealth is sure to break down defenders of oligarchy pretend that income isproportional to virtue the psalmist said he had never seen a righteous man begging his bread and aristotle thinks that good men acquire just about his own income neither very large nor verysmall but such views are absurd every kind of justice other than absolute equality will inpractice reward some quality quite other than virtue and is therefore to be condemned there is an interesting section on tyranny a tyrant desires riches whereas a king desires honour the tyrant has guards who are mercenaries whereas the king has guards who are citizens tyrantsare mostly demagogues who acquire power by promising to protect the people against thenotables in an ironically machiavellian tone aristotle explains what a tyrant must do to retainpower he must prevent the rise of any person of exceptional merit by execution or assassinationif necessary he must prohibit common meals clubs and any education likely to produce hostilesentiment there must be no literary assemblies or discussions he must prevent people fromknowing each other well and compel them to live in public at his gates he should employ spieslike the female detectives at syracuse 
this or that portion of my subject less adequate than it would have been if there bad been no needto remember times winged chariot this book owes its existence to dr albert c barnes having been originally designed and partlydelivered as lectures at the barnes foundation in pennsylvania as in most of my work during the last thirteen years i have been greatly assisted in research andin many other ways by my wife patricia russell bertrand russell introductionthe conceptions of life and the world which we call philosophical are a product of two factorsone inherited religious and ethical conceptions the other the sort of investigation which may becalled scientific using this word in its broadest sense individual philosophers have differedwidely in regard to the proportions in which these two factors entered into their systems but it isthe presence of both in some degree that characterizes philosophy philosophy is a word which has been used in many ways some wider some narrower i proposeto use it in a very wide sense which i will now try to explain philosophy as i shall understand the word is something intermediate between theology andscience like theology it consists of speculations on matters as to which definite knowledge hasso far been unascertainable but like science it appeals to human reason rather than to authoritywhether that of tradition or that of revelation all definite knowledgeso i should contendbelongs to science all dogma as to what surpasses definite knowledge belongs to theology butbetween theology and science there is a no mans land exposed to attack from both sides this no mans land is philosophy almost all the questions of most interest to speculative minds aresuch as science cannot answer and the confident answers of theologians no longer seem soconvincing as they did in former centuries is the world divided into mind and matter and if sowhat is mind and what is matter is mind subject to matter or is it possessed of independentpowers has the universe any unity or purpose is it evolving towards some goal are there reallylaws of nature or do we believe in them only because of our innate love of order is man what heseems to the astronomer a tiny lump of impure carbon and water impotently crawling on a smalland unimportant planet or is he what he appears to hamlet is he perhaps both at once is therea way of living that is noble and another that is base or are all ways of living merely futile ifthere is a way of living that is noble in what does it consist and how shall we achieve it mustthe good be eternal in order to deserve to be valued or is it worth seeking even if the universe is inexorably moving towards death is there such a thing as wisdom or is what seems suchmerely the ultimate refinement of folly to such questions no answer can be found in thelaboratory theologies have professed to give answers all too definite but their very definitenesscauses modern minds to view them with suspicion the studying of these questions if not theanswering of them is the business of philosophy why then you may ask waste time on such insoluble problems to this one may answer as ahistorian or as an individual facing the terror of cosmic loneliness the answer of the historian in so far as i am capable of giving it will appear in the course of thiswork ever since men became capable of free speculation their actions in innumerable importantrespects have depended upon their theories as to the world and human life as to what is good andwhat is evil this is as true in the present day as at any former time to understand an age or anation we must understand its philosophy and to understand its philosophy we must ourselves bein some degree philosophers there is here a reciprocal causation the circumstances of menslives do much to determine their philosophy but conversely their philosophy does much todetermine their circumstances this interaction throughout the centuries will be the topic of thefollowing pages there is also however a more personal answer science tells us what we can know but what wecan know is little and if we forget how much we cannot know we become insensitive to manythings of very great importance theology on the other hand induces a dogmatic belief that wehave knowledge where in fact we have ignorance and by doing so generates a kind of impertinentinsolence towards the universe uncertainty in the presence of vivid hopes and fears is painfulbut must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting fairy tales it is not goodeither to forget the questions that philosophy asks or to persuade ourselves that we have foundindubitable answers to them to teach how to live without certainty and yet without beingparalyzed by hesitation is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy in our age can still do for thosewho study it philosophy as distinct from theology began in greece in the sixth century bc after running itscourse

trialism with a scientific technique very different from traditional culture a third cause waspopular education which conferred the power to read and write but did not confer culture thisenabled a new type of demagogue to practise a new type of propaganda as seen in thedictatorships both for good and evil therefore the day of the cultured gentleman is past chapter xxii aristotles logic aristotles influence which was very great in many different fields was greatest of all inlogic in late antiquity when plato was still supreme in metaphysics aristotle was the recognizedauthority in logic and he retained this position throughout the middle ages it was not till thethirteenth century that christian philosophers accorded him supremacy in the field of metaphysics this supremacy was largely lost after the renaissance but his supremacy in logic survived evenat the present day all catholic teachers of philosophy and many others still obstinately reject thediscoveries of modern logic and adhere with a strange tenacity to a system which is as definitelyantiquated as ptolemaic astronomy this makes it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle hispresentday influence is so inimical to clear thinking that it is hard to remember how great anadvance he made upon all his predecessors or how admirable his logical workwould still seem if it had been a stage in a continual progress instead of being adead end followed by over two thousand years of stagnation in dealing with the predecessors of aristotle it is not necessary to remind the reader that they are not verbally inspired one cantherefore praise them for their ability without being supposed to subscribe to all their doctrines aristotle on the contrary is still especially in logic a battleground and cannot be treated in apurely historical spirit aristotles most important work in logic is the doctrine of the syllogism a syllogism is anargument consisting of three parts a major premiss a minor premiss and a conclusion syllogisms are of a number of different kinds each of which has a name given by the scholastics the most familiar is the kind called barbara all men are mortal socrates is a man therefore socrates ismortal or all men are mortal all greeks are men therefore all greeks aremortal other forms are no fishes are rational all sharks are fishes therefore no sharks are rational all men are rational some animals are men therefore some animals are rational no greeks are black some men are greeks therefore some men are not black these four make up the first figure aristotle adds a second and third figure and the schoolmenadded a fourth it is shown that the three later figures can be reduced to the first by variousdevices there are some inferences that can be made from a single premiss from some men are mortalwe can infer that some mortals are men according to aristotle this can also be inferred fromall men are mortal from no gods are mortal we can infer no mortals are gods but fromsome men are not greeke it does not follow that some greeks are not men apart from such inferences as the above aristotle and his followers thought that all deductiveinference when strictly stated is syllogistic by setting forth all the valid kinds of syllogism andsetting out any suggested argument in syllogistic form it should therefore be possible to avoid allfallacies this system was the beginning of formal logic and as such was both important and admirable but considered as the end not the beginning of formal logic it is open to three kinds of criticism 
aristotles most important work in logic is the doctrine of the syllogism a syllogism is anargument consisting of three parts a major premiss a minor premiss and a conclusion syllogisms are of a number of different kinds each of which has a name given by the scholastics the most familiar is the kind called barbara all men are mortal socrates is a man therefore socrates ismortal or all men are mortal all greeks are men therefore all greeks aremortal other forms are no fishes are rational all sharks are fishes therefore no sharks are rational all men are rational some animals are men therefore some animals are rational no greeks are black some men are greeks therefore some men are not black these four make up the first figure aristotle adds a second and third figure and the schoolmenadded a fourth it is shown that the three later figures can be reduced to the first by variousdevices there are some inferences that can be made from a single premiss from some men are mortalwe can infer that some mortals are men according to aristotle this can also be inferred fromall men are mortal from no gods are mortal we can infer no mortals are gods but fromsome men are not greeke it does not follow that some greeks are not men apart from such inferences as the above aristotle and his followers thought that all deductiveinference when strictly stated is syllogistic by setting forth all the valid kinds of syllogism andsetting out any suggested argument in syllogistic form it should therefore be possible to avoid allfallacies this system was the beginning of formal logic and as such was both important and admirable but considered as the end not the beginning of formal logic it is open to three kinds of criticism formal defects within the system itself overestimation of the syllogism as compared to other forms of deductive argument overestimation of deduction as a form of argument on each of these three something must be said formal defects let us begin with the two statements socrates is a man and all greeks aremen it is necessary to make a sharp distinction between these two which is not done in aristotelian logic the statement all greeks are men is commonly interpreted as implying thatthere are greeks without this implication some of aristotles syllogisms are not valid take forinstance all greeks are men all greeks are white therefore some men are white this is valid if thereare greeks but not otherwise if i were to say all golden mountains are mountains all golden mountains are golden therefore some mountainsare golden my conclusion would be false though in some sense my premisses would be true ifwe are to be explicit we must therefore divide the one statement all greeks are men into twoone saying there are greeks and the other saying if anything is a greek it is a man the latterstatement is purely hypothetical and does not imply that there are greeks the statement all greeks are men is thus much more complex in form than the statement socrates is a man socrates is a man has socrates for its subject but all greeks are mendoes not have all greeks for its subject for there is nothing about all greeks either in thestatement there are greeks or in the statement if anything is a greek it is a man this purely formal error was a source of errors in metaphysics and theory of knowledge considerthe state of our knowledge in regard to the two propositions socrates is mortal and all men aremortal in order to know the truth of socrates is mortal most of us are content to rely upontestimony but if testimony is to be reliable it must lead us back to some one who knew socratesand saw him dead the one perceived factthe dead body of socratestogether with theknowledge that this was called socrates was enough to assure us of the mortality of socrates but when it comes to all men are mortal the matter is different the question of our knowledgeof such general propositions is a very difficult one sometimes 
 formal defects within the system itself overestimation of the syllogism as compared to other forms of deductive argument overestimation of deduction as a form of argument on each of these three something must be said formal defects let us begin with the two statements socrates is a man and all greeks aremen it is necessary to make a sharp distinction between these two which is not done in aristotelian logic the statement all greeks are men is commonly interpreted as implying thatthere are greeks without this implication some of aristotles syllogisms are not valid take forinstance all greeks are men all greeks are white therefore some men are white this is valid if thereare greeks but not otherwise if i were to say all golden mountains are mountains all golden mountains are golden therefore some mountainsare golden my conclusion would be false though in some sense my premisses would be true ifwe are to be explicit we must therefore divide the one statement all greeks are men into twoone saying there are greeks and the other saying if anything is a greek it is a man the latterstatement is purely hypothetical and does not imply that there are greeks the statement all greeks are men is thus much more complex in form than the statement socrates is a man socrates is a man has socrates for its subject but all greeks are mendoes not have all greeks for its subject for there is nothing about all greeks either in thestatement there are greeks or in the statement if anything is a greek it is a man this purely formal error was a source of errors in metaphysics and theory of knowledge considerthe state of our knowledge in regard to the two propositions socrates is mortal and all men aremortal in order to know the truth of socrates is mortal most of us are content to rely upontestimony but if testimony is to be reliable it must lead us back to some one who knew socratesand saw him dead the one perceived factthe dead body of socratestogether with theknowledge that this was called socrates was enough to assure us of the mortality of socrates but when it comes to all men are mortal the matter is different the question of our knowledgeof such general propositions is a very difficult one sometimes they are merely verbal all greeks are men is known because nothing is called a greek unlessit is a man such general statements can be ascertained from the dictionary they tell us nothingabout the world except how words are used but all men are mortal is not of this sort there isnothing logically selfcontradictory about an immortal man we believe the proposition on thebasis of induction because there is no wellauthenticated case of a man living more than years but this only makes the proposition probable not certain it cannot be certain so long asliving men exist metaphysical errors arose through supposing that all men is the subject of all men are mortalin the same sense as that in which socrates is the subject of socrates is mortal it made itpossible to hold that in some sense all men denotes an entity of the same sort as that denotedby socrates this led aristotle to say that in a sense a species is a substance he is careful toqualify this statement but his followers especially porphyry showed less caution another error into which aristotle falls through this mistake is to think that a predicate of apredicate can be a predicate of the original subject if i say socrates is greek all greeks arehuman aristotle thinks that human is a predicate of greek while greek is a predicate of socrates and obviously human is a predicate of socrates but in fact human is not apredicate of greek the distinction between names and predicates or in metaphysical languagebetween particulars and universals is thus blurred with disastrous consequences to philosophy one of the resulting confusions was to suppose that a class with only one member is identical withthat one member this made it impossible to have a correct theory of the number one and led toendless bad metaphysics about unity overestimation of the syllogism the syllogism is only one kind of deductive argument inmathematics which is wholly deductive syllogisms hardly ever occur of course it would bepossible to rewrite mathematical arguments in syllogistic form but this would be very artificialand would not make them any more cogent take arithmetic for example if i buy goods worth and tender a bill in payment how much change is due to me to put this simple sum inthe form of a syllogism would be absurd and would tend to conceal the real nature of theargument again within logic there are nonsyllogistic inferences such as a horse is an animalthere 
they are merely verbal all greeks are men is known because nothing is called a greek unlessit is a man such general statements can be ascertained from the dictionary they tell us nothingabout the world except how words are used but all men are mortal is not of this sort there isnothing logically selfcontradictory about an immortal man we believe the proposition on thebasis of induction because there is no wellauthenticated case of a man living more than years but this only makes the proposition probable not certain it cannot be certain so long asliving men exist metaphysical errors arose through supposing that all men is the subject of all men are mortalin the same sense as that in which socrates is the subject of socrates is mortal it made itpossible to hold that in some sense all men denotes an entity of the same sort as that denotedby socrates this led aristotle to say that in a sense a species is a substance he is careful toqualify this statement but his followers especially porphyry showed less caution another error into which aristotle falls through this mistake is to think that a predicate of apredicate can be a predicate of the original subject if i say socrates is greek all greeks arehuman aristotle thinks that human is a predicate of greek while greek is a predicate of socrates and obviously human is a predicate of socrates but in fact human is not apredicate of greek the distinction between names and predicates or in metaphysical languagebetween particulars and universals is thus blurred with disastrous consequences to philosophy one of the resulting confusions was to suppose that a class with only one member is identical withthat one member this made it impossible to have a correct theory of the number one and led toendless bad metaphysics about unity overestimation of the syllogism the syllogism is only one kind of deductive argument inmathematics which is wholly deductive syllogisms hardly ever occur of course it would bepossible to rewrite mathematical arguments in syllogistic form but this would be very artificialand would not make them any more cogent take arithmetic for example if i buy goods worth and tender a bill in payment how much change is due to me to put this simple sum inthe form of a syllogism would be absurd and would tend to conceal the real nature of theargument again within logic there are nonsyllogistic inferences such as a horse is an animalthere fore a horses head is an animals head valid syllogisms in fact are only some among validdeductions and have no logical priority over others the attempt to give preeminence to thesyllogism in deduction misled philosophers as to the nature of mathematical reasoning kant whoperceived that mathematics is not syllogistic inferred that it uses extralogical principles whichhowever he supposed to be as certain as those of logic he like his predecessors though in adifferent way was misled by respect for aristotle overestimation of deduction the greeks in general attached more importance to deductionas a source of knowledge than modern philosophers do in this respect aristotle was less at faultthan plato he repeatedly admitted the importance of induction and he devoted considerableattention to the question how do we know the first premisses from which deduction must start nevertheless he like other greeks gave undue prominence to deduction in his theory ofknowledge we shall agree that mr smith is mortal and we may loosely say that we knowthis because we know that all men are mortal but what we really know is not all men aremortal we know rather something like all men born more than one hundred and fifty years agoare mortal and so are almost all men born more than one hundred years ago this is our reasonfor thinking that mr smith will die but this argument is an induction not a deduction it has lesscogency than a deduction and yields only a probability not a certainty but on the other hand itgives new knowledge which deduction does not all the important inferences outside logic andpure mathematics are inductive not deductive the only exceptions are law and theology each ofwhich derives its first principles from an unquestionable text viz the statute books or thescriptures apart from the prior analytics which deals with the syllogism there are other writings of aristotle which have considerable importance in the history of philosophy one of these is theshort work on the categories porphyry the neoplatonist wrote a commentary on this bookwhich had a very notable influence on medieval philosophy but for the present let us ignore porphyry and confine ourselves to aristotle what exactly is meant by the word category whether in aristotle or in kant and hegel i mustconfess that i have never been able

essence is one as to the use of words we apply the same name on different occasions tosomewhat different occurrences which we regard as manifestations of a single thing orperson in fact however this is only a verbal convenience the essence of socrates thusconsists of those properties in the absence of which we should not use the name socrates thequestion is purely linguistic a word may have an essence but a thing cannot the conception of substance like that of essence is a transference to metaphysics of what isonly a linguistic convenience we find it convenient in describing the world to describe a certainnumber of occurrences as events in the life of socrates and a certain number of others as eventsin the life of mr smith this leads us to think of socrates or mr smith as denotingsomething that persists through a certain number of years and as in some way more solid andreal than the events that happen to him if socrates is ill we think that socrates at other timesis well and therefore the being of socrates is independent of his illness illness on the other handrequires somebody to be ill but although socrates need not be ill something must be occurring tohim if he is to be considered to exist he is not therefore really any more solid than the thingsthat happen to him substance when taken seriously is a concept impossible to free from difficulties a substanceis supposed to be the subject of properties and to be something distinct from all its properties butwhen we take away the properties and try to imagine the substance by itself we find that there isnothing left to put the matter in another way what distinguishes one substance from another not difference of properties for according to the logic of substance difference of propertiespresupposes numerical diversity between the substances concerned two substances thereforemust be just two without being in themselves in any way distinguishable how then are weever to find out that they are two substance in fact is merely a convenient way of collecting events into bundles what can weknow about mr smith when we look at him we see a pattern of colours when we listen to himtalking we hear a series of sounds we believe that like us he has thoughts and feelings butwhat is mr smith apart from all these occurrences a mere imaginary hook from which theoccurrences are supposed to hang they have in fact no need of a hook any more than the earth needs anelephant to rest upon any one can see in the analogous case of a geographical region that such aword as france is only a linguistic convenience and that there is not a thing called france over and above its various parts the same holds of mr smith it is a collective namefor a number of occurrences if we take it as anything more it denotes something completelyunknowable and therefore not needed for the expression of what we know substance in a word is a metaphysical mistake due to transference to the worldstructure of thestructure of sentences composed of a subject and a predicate i conclude that the aristotelian doctrines with which we have been concerned in this chapter arewholly false with the exception of the formal theory of the syllogism which is unimportant anyperson in the present day who wishes to learn logic will be wasting his time if he reads aristotleor any of his disciples none the less aristotles logical writings show great ability and wouldhave been useful to mankind if they had appeared at a time when intellectual originality was stillactive unfortunately they appeared at the very end of the creative period of greek thought andtherefore came to be accepted as authoritative by the time that logical orginality revived a reignof two thousand years had made aristotle very

stands comparatively alone asmaster of a mainly lifeless and largely subservient material environment to the greek attempting to give a scientific account of motion the purely mechanical view hardlysuggested itself except in the case of a few men of genius such as democritus and archimedes two sets of phenomena seemed important the movements of animals and the movements of theheavenly bodies to the modern man of science the body of an animal is a very elaboratemachine with an enormously complex physicochemical structure every new discovery consistsin diminishing the apparent gulf between animals and machines to the greek it seemed morenatural to assimilate apparently lifeless motions to those of animals a child still distinguishes liveanimals from other things by the fact that they can move of themselves to many greeks andespecially to aristotle this peculiarity suggested itself as the basis of a general theory of physics but how about the heavenly bodies they differ from animals by the regularity of theirmovements but this may be only due to their superior perfection every greek philosopherwhatever he may have come to think in adult life had been taught in childhood to regard the sunand moon as gods anaxagoras was prosecuted for impiety because he thought that they were notalive it was natural that a philosopher who could no longer regard the heavenly bodies themselvesas divine should think of them as moved by the will of a divine being who had a hellenic love oforder and geometrical simplicity thus the ultimate source of all movement is will on earth thecapricious will of human beings and animals but in heaven the unchanging will of the supreme artificer i do not suggest that this applies to every detail of what aristotle has to say what i do suggest isthat it gives his imaginative background and represents the sort of thing which in embarking onhis investigations he would expect to find true after these preliminaries let us examine what it is that he actually says physics in aristotle is the science of what the greeks called phusis a word whichis translated nature but has not exactly the meaning which we attach to that word we

of natural science and natural history but nature by itself though it is a very ambiguousword seldom means just what phusis meant phusis had to do with growth one might say it isthe nature of an acorn to grow into an oak and in that case one would be using the word in the aristotelian sense the nature of a thing aristotle says is its end that for the sake of which itexists thus the word has a teleological implication some things exist by nature some from othercauses animals plants and simple bodies exist by nature they have an internalprinciple of motion nature is asource of being moved or at rest things have a nature if they have an internal principle of thiskind the phrase according to nature applies to these things and their essential attributes nature is in form rather thanin matter what is potentially flesh or bone has not yet acquired its own nature and a thing is morewhat it is when it has attained to fulfilment this whole point of view seems to be suggested bybiology the acorn is potentially an oak nature belongs to the class of causes which operate for the sake of something this leads to adiscussion of the view that nature works of necessity without purpose in connection with which aristotle discusses the survival of the fittest in the form taught by empedocles this cannot beright he says because things happen in fixed ways and when a series has a completion allpreceding steps are for its sake those things are natural which by a continuous movementoriginated from an internal principle arrive at some completion this whole conception of nature though it might well seem admirably suited to explain thegrowth of animals and plants became in the event a great obstacle to the progress of science anda source of much that was bad in ethics in the latter respect it is still harmful motion we are told is the fulfilling of what exists potentially this view apart from other defectsis incompatible with the relativity of locomotion when a moves relatively to b b movesrelatively to a and there is no sense in saying that one of the two is in motion while the other is atrest when a dog seizes a bone it seems to common sense that the dog moves while the bone remains at rest and that the motion has apurpose namely to fulfil the dogs nature but it has turned out that this point of view cannot beapplied to dead matter and that for the purposes of scientific physics no conception of an endis useful nor can any motion in scientific strictness be treated as other than relative aristotle rejects the void as maintained by leucippus and democritus he then passes on to arather curious discussion of time it might he says be maintained that time does not exist since itis composed of past and future of which one no longer exists while the other does not yet exist this view however he rejects time he says is motion that admits of numeration we may fairly ask he continues whether time could existwithout the soul since there cannot be anything to count unless there is some one to count andtime involves numeration it seems that he thinks of time as so many hours or days or years somethings he adds are eternal in the sense of not being in time presumably he is thinking of suchthings as numbers there always has been motion and there always will be for there cannot be time without motionand all are agreed that time is uncreated except plato on this point christian followers of aristotle were obliged to dissent from him since the bible tells us that the universe had abeginning the physics ends with the argument for an unmoved mover which we considered in connectionwith the metaphysics there is one unmoved mover which directly causes a circular motion circular motion is the primary kind and the only kind which can be continuous and infinite thefirst mover has no parts or magnitude and is at the circumference of the world having reached this conclusion we pass on to the heavens the treatise on the heavens sets forth a pleasant and simple theory things below the moon aresubject to generation and decay from the moon upwards everything is ungenerated andindestructible the earth which is spherical is at the centre of the universe in the sublunarysphere everything is composed of the four elements earth water air and fire but there is a fifthelement of which the heavenly bodies are composed the natural movement of the terrestrialelements is rectilinear but that of the fifth element is circular the 
sense that the dog moves while the bone remains at rest and that the motion has apurpose namely to fulfil the dogs nature but it has turned out that this point of view cannot beapplied to dead matter and that for the purposes of scientific physics no conception of an endis useful nor can any motion in scientific strictness be treated as other than relative aristotle rejects the void as maintained by leucippus and democritus he then passes on to arather curious discussion of time it might he says be maintained that time does not exist since itis composed of past and future of which one no longer exists while the other does not yet exist this view however he rejects time he says is motion that admits of numeration we may fairly ask he continues whether time could existwithout the soul since there cannot be anything to count unless there is some one to count andtime involves numeration it seems that he thinks of time as so many hours or days or years somethings he adds are eternal in the sense of not being in time presumably he is thinking of suchthings as numbers there always has been motion and there always will be for there cannot be time without motionand all are agreed that time is uncreated except plato on this point christian followers of aristotle were obliged to dissent from him since the bible tells us that the universe had abeginning the physics ends with the argument for an unmoved mover which we considered in connectionwith the metaphysics there is one unmoved mover which directly causes a circular motion circular motion is the primary kind and the only kind which can be continuous and infinite thefirst mover has no parts or magnitude and is at the circumference of the world having reached this conclusion we pass on to the heavens the treatise on the heavens sets forth a pleasant and simple theory things below the moon aresubject to generation and decay from the moon upwards everything is ungenerated andindestructible the earth which is spherical is at the centre of the universe in the sublunarysphere everything is composed of the four elements earth water air and fire but there is a fifthelement of which the heavenly bodies are composed the natural movement of the terrestrialelements is rectilinear but that of the fifth element is circular the heavens are perfectly spherical and the upper regions are more divine than the lower the starsand planets are not composed of fire but of the fifth element their motion is due to that of spheresto which they are attached the four terrestrial elements are not eternal but are generated out of each otherfire is absolutelylight in the sense that its natural motion is upward earth is absolutely heavy air is relativelylight and water is relatively heavy this theory provided many difficulties for later ages comets which were recognized asdestructible had to be assigned to the sublunary sphere but in the seventeenth century it wasfound that they describe orbits round the sun and are very seldom as near as the moon since thenatural motion of terrestrial bodies is rectilinear it was held that a projectile fired horizontally willmove horizontally for a time and then suddenly begin to fall vertically galileos discovery that aprojectile moves in a parabola shocked his aristotelian colleagues copernicus kepler and galileo had to combat aristotle as well as the bible in establishing the view that the earth is notthe centre of the universe but rotates once a day and goes round the sun once a year to come to a more general matter aristotelian physics is incompatible with newton first lawof motion originally enunciated by galileo this law states that every body left to itself will ifalready in motion continue to move in a straight line with uniform velocity thus outside causesare required not to account for motion but to account for change of motion either in velocity orin direction circular motion which aristotle thought natural for the heavenly bodies involves acontinual change in the direction of motion and therefore requires a force directed towards thecentre of the circle as in newtons law of gravitation finally the view that the heavenly bodies are eternal and incorruptible has had to be abandoned the sun and stars have long lives but do not live for ever they are born from a nebula and in theend they either explode or die of cold nothing in the visible world is exempt from change anddecay the aristotelian belief to the contrary though accepted by medieval christians is a productof the pagan worship of sun and moon and planets

lived at the end of the fifth century bc although it is fanciful and in part quite unscientific itis very important since it involves the greater part of the imaginative effort required forconceiving the copernican hypothesis to conceive of the earth not as the centre of theuniverse but as one among the planets not as eternally fixed but as wandering through spaceshowed an extraordinary emancipation from anthropocentric thinking when once this jolt hadbeen given to mens natural picture of the universe it was not so very difficult to be led byscientific arguments to a more accurate theory to this various observations contributed oenopides who was slightly later than anaxagorasdiscovered the obliquity of the ecliptic it soon became clear that the sun must be much largerthan the earth which fact supported those who denied that the earth is the centre of theuniverse the central fire and the counterearth were dropped by the pythagoreans soon after thetime of plato heraclides of pontus discovered that venus and mercury revolve about the sun and adopted the view thatthe earth rotates on its own axis once every twentyfour hours this last was a very importantstep which no predecessor had taken heraclides was of platos school and must have been agreat man but was not as much respected as one would expect he is described as a fat dandy aristarchus of samos who lived approximately from to bc and was thus abouttwentyfive years older than archimedes is the most interesting of all ancient astronomersbecause he advanced the complete copernican hypothesis that all the planets including theearth revolve in circles round the sun and that the earth rotates on its axis once in twentyfourhours it is a little disappointing to find that the only extant work of aristarchus on the sizesand distances of the sun and the moon adheres to the geocentric view it is true that for theproblems with which this book deals it makes no difference which theory is adopted and hemay therefore have thought it unwise to burden his calculations with an unnecessary oppositionto the general opinion of astronomers or he may have only arrived at the copernican hypothesisafter writing

fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved that the earth revolves about the sun in thecircumference of a circle the sun lying in the middle of the orbit there is a passage in plutarch saying that cleanthes thought it was the duty of the greeks to indict aristarchus of samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the hearth of the universe this being the effect of his attempt to save the phenomena by supposing the heaven to remain atrest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle while it rotates at the same time about its ownaxis cleanthes was a contemporary of aristarchus and

thousand years later was influenced by the fear ofoffending religious prejudices a fear which the attitude of cleanthes showsto have been well grounded the copernican hypothesis after being advanced whether positively or tentatively by aristarchus was definitely adopted by seleucus but by no other ancient astronomer thisgeneral rejection was mainly due to hipparchus who flourished from to bc he

that northern races are spirited southern races civilized but the greeks alone are both spirited andcivilized plato and aristotle thought it wrong to make slaves of greeks but not of barbarians alexander who was not quite a greek tried to break down this attitude of superiority he himselfmarried two barbarian princesses and he compelled his leading macedonians to marry persianwomen of noble birth his innumerable greek cities one would suppose must have containedmany more male than female colonists and their men must therefore have followed his examplein intermarrying with the women of the locality the result of this policy was to bring into theminds of thoughtful men the conception of mankind as a whole the old loyalty to the city stateand to the greek race seemed no longer adequate in philosophy thiscosmopolitan point of view begins with the stoics but in practice it begins earlier with alexander it had the result that the interaction of greek and barbarian was reciprocal thebarbarians learnt something of greek science while the greeks learnt much of barbariansuperstition greek civilization in covering a wider area became less purely greek greek civilization was essentially urban there were of course many greeks engaged inagriculture but they contributed little to what was distinctive in hellenic culture from the milesian school onwards the greeks who were eminent in science and philosophy and literaturewere associated with rich commercial cities often surrounded by barbarian populations this typeof civilization was inaugurated not by the greeks but by the phoenicians tyre and sidon and carthage depended on slaves for manual labour at home and on hired mercenaries in the conductof their wars they did not depend as modern capital cities do upon large rural populations of thesame blood and with equal political rights the nearest modern analogue is to be seen in the far east during the latter half of the nineteenth century singapore and hong kong shanghai and theother treaty ports of china were little european islands where the white men formed acommercial aristocracy living on coolie labour in north america north of the mason dixon linesince such labour was not available white men were compelled to practise agriculture for thisreason the hold of the white man on north america is secure while his hold on the far east hasalready been greatly diminished and may easily cease altogether much of his type of cultureespecially industrialism will however survive this analogue will help us to understand the position ofthe greeks in the eastern parts of alexanders empire the effect of alexander on the imagination of asia was great and lasting the first book of the maccabees written centuries after his death opens with an account of his career and it happened after that alexander son of philip the macedonian who came out of the landof chettiim had smitten darius king of the persians and medes that he reigned in his stead thefirst over greece and made many wars and won many strong holds and slew the kings of theearth and went through to the ends of the earth and took spoils of many nations insomuch thatthe earth was quiet before him whereupon he was exalted and his heart was lifted up and hegathered a mighty strong host and ruled over countries and nations and kings who becametributaries unto him and after these things he fell sick and perceived that he should die wherefore he called his servants such as were honorable and had been brought up with himfrom his youth and parted his kingdom among them while he was yet alive so alexanderreigned twelve years and then died he survived as a legendary hero in the mohammedan religion and to this day petty chieftains inthe himalayas claim to be descended from him no other fully historical hero has everfurnished such a perfect opportunity for the mythopoeic faculty at alexanders death there was an attempt to preserve the unity of his empire but of his twosons one was an infant and the other was not yet born each had supporters but in the resultantcivil war both were thrust aside in the end his empire was divided between the families ofthree generals of whom roughly speaking one obtained the european one the african andone the asiatic parts of alexanders possessions the european part fell ultimately to antigonuss descendants ptolemy who obtained egypt made alexandria his capital seleucuswho obtained asia after many wars was too busy with campaigns to have a fixed capital but inlater times antioch was the chief city of his dynasty  this is not historically true perhaps this is no longer true as the sons of those who held this belief have been educatedat eton

perialistic ruthless and stupid he failed however later romans while retaining many of hisvices adopted those of carneades also the next head of the academy after carneades was a carthaginianwhose real name was hasdrubal but who in his dealings with greeks preferred to call himself clitomachus unlike carneades who confined himself to lecturing clitomachus wrote over fourhundred books some of them in the phoenician language his principles appear to have been thesame as those of carneades in some respects they were useful these two sceptics setthemselves against the belief in divination magic and astrology which was becoming more andmore widespread they also developed a constructive doctrine concerning degrees of probabilityalthough we can never be justified in feeling certainty some things are more likely to be true thanothers probability should be our guide in practice since it is reasonable to act on the mostprobable of possible hypotheses this view is one with which most modern philosophers wouldagree unfortunately the books setting it forth are lost and it is difficult to reconstruct thedoctrine from the hints that remain after clitomachus the academy ceased to be sceptical and from the time of antiochus its doctrines became for centuries practically indistinguishable from those of the stoics scepticism however did not disappear it was revived by the cretan aenesidemus who camefrom knossos where for aught we know there may have been sceptics two thousand yearsearlier entertaining dissolute courtiers with doubts as to the divinity of the mistress of animals the date of aenesidemus is uncertain he threw over the doctrines on probability advocated by carneades and reverted to the earliest forms of scepticism his influence was considerable hewas followed by the poet lucian in the second century ad and also slightly later by sextus empiricus the only sceptic philosopher of antiquity whose works survive there is for examplea short treatise arguments against belief in a god translated by edwyn bevan in his later greek religion pp and said by him to be probably taken by sextus empiricus from carneades as reported by clitomachus this treatise begins by explaining that in behaviour the sceptics are orthodox we scepticsfollow in practice the way of the world but without holding any opinion about it we speak of the gods as existing and offer worship to the gods and say that they exercise providence but in saying thiswe express no belief and avoid the rashness of the dogmatisers he then argues that people differ as to the nature of god for instance some think him corporealsome incorporeal since we have no experience of him we cannot know his attributes theexistence of god is not selfevident and therefore needs proof there is a somewhat confusedargument to show that no such proof is possible he next takes up the problem of evil andconcludes with the words those who affirm positively that god exists cannot avoid falling into an impiety for if they saythat god controls everything they make him the author of evil things if on the other hand theysay that he controls some things only or that he controls nothing they are compelled to make god either grudging or impotent and to do that is quite obviously an impiety scepticism while it continued to appeal to some cultivated individuals until somewhere in thethird century ad was contrary to the temper of the age which was turning more and more todogmatic religion and doctrines of salvation scepticism had enough force to make educated mendissatisfied with the state religions but it had nothing positive even in the purely intellectualsphere to offer in their place from the renaissance onwards theological scepticism has beensupplemented in most of its advocates by an enthusiastic belief in science but in antiquity therewas no such supplement to doubt without answering the arguments of the sceptics the ancientworld turned aside from them the olympians being discredited the way was left clear for aninvasion of oriental religions which competed for the favour of the superstitious until the triumphof christianity chapter xxvii the epicureans two great new schools of the hellenistic period the stoics and epicureans werecontemporaneous in their foundation their founders zeno and epicurus were born at aboutthe same time and settled in athens as heads of their respective sects within a few years of eachother it is therefore a matter of taste which to consider first i shall begin with the epicureansbecause their doctrines were fixed once

as existing and offer worship to the gods and say that they exercise providence but in saying thiswe express no belief and avoid the rashness of the dogmatisers he then argues that people differ as to the nature of god for instance some think him corporealsome incorporeal since we have no experience of him we cannot know his attributes theexistence of god is not selfevident and therefore needs proof there is a somewhat confusedargument to show that no such proof is possible he next takes up the problem of evil andconcludes with the words those who affirm positively that god exists cannot avoid falling into an impiety for if they saythat god controls everything they make him the author of evil things if on the other hand theysay that he controls some things only or that he controls nothing they are compelled to make god either grudging or impotent and to do that is quite obviously an impiety scepticism while it continued to appeal to some cultivated individuals until somewhere in thethird century ad was contrary to the temper of the age which was turning more and more todogmatic religion and doctrines of salvation scepticism had enough force to make educated mendissatisfied with the state religions but it had nothing positive even in the purely intellectualsphere to offer in their place from the renaissance onwards theological scepticism has beensupplemented in most of its advocates by an enthusiastic belief in science but in antiquity therewas no such supplement to doubt without answering the arguments of the sceptics the ancientworld turned aside from them the

two great new schools of the hellenistic period the stoics and epicureans werecontemporaneous in their foundation their founders zeno and epicurus were born at aboutthe same time and settled in athens

foundation there is against it the fact that he had an unusually strong affection for his mother the main facts of the life of epicurus seem however fairly certain his father was a poor athenian colonist in samos epicurus was born in bc but whether in samos or in attica is not known in any case his boyhood was passed in samos he states that he took to thestudy of philosophy at the age of fourteen at the age of eighteen about the time of alexandersdeath he went to athens apparently to establish his citizenship but while he was there the athenian colonists were turned out of samos the family of epicurus becamerefugees in asia minor where he rejoined them at taos either at this time or perhaps earlierhe was taught philosophy by a certain nausiphanes apparently a follower of democritus although his mature philosophy owes more to democritus than to any other philosopher henever expressed anything but contempt for nausiphanes whom he alluded to as the molluscin the year he founded his school which was first in mitylene then in lampsacus andfrom onwards in athens where he died in bc after the hard years of his youth his life in athens was placid and was only troubled by his illhealth he had a house and a garden and it was in thegarden that he taught his three brothers and some others had been members of his schoolfrom the first but in athens his community was increased not only by philosophic disciplesbut by friends and their children slaves and betaerae these last were made an occasion ofscandal by his enemies but apparently quite unjustly he had a very

the main doctrines to which the school remained constant throughout are concerned with cosmicdeterminism and human freedom zeno believed that there is no such thing as chance and that thecourse of nature is rigidly determined by natural laws originally there was only fire then theother elementsair water earth in that ordergradually emerged but sooner or later there will bea cosmic conflagration and all will again become fire this according to most stoics is not afinal consummation like the end of the world in christian doctrine but only the conclusion of acycle the whole process will be repeated endlessly everything that happens has happened beforeand will happen again not once but countless times so far the doctrine might seem cheerless and in no respect more comforting than ordinarymaterialism such as that of democritus but this was only one aspect of it the course of nature in stoicism as in eighteenthcentury theology was ordained by a lawgiver who was also abeneficent providence down to the smallest detail the whole was designed to secure certain endsby natural means these ends except in so far as they concern gods and daemons are to be foundin the life of man everything has a purpose connected with human beings some animals aregood to eat some afford tests of courage even bed bugs are useful since they help us to wake inthe morning and not lie in bed too long the supreme power is called sometimes god sometimes zeus seneca distinguished this zeus from the object of popular belief who was also real butsubordinate god is not separate from the world he is the soul of the world and each of us contains a part ofthe divine fire all things are parts of one single system which is called nature the individuallife is good when it is in harmony with nature in one sense every life is in harmony with naturesince it is such as natures laws have caused it to be but in another sense a human life is only inharmony with nature when the individual will is directed to ends which are among those of nature virtue consists in a will which is in agreement with nature the wicked though perforcethey obey gods law do so involuntarily in the simile of cleanthes they are like a dog tied to acart and compelled to go wherever it goes in the life of an individual man virtue is the sole good such things as health happinesspossessions are of no account since virtue resides in the will everything really good or bad in amans life depends only upon himself he may become poor but what of it he can still be virtuous a tyrant may put himin prison but he can still persevere in living in harmony with nature he may be sentenced todeath but he can die nobly like socrates other men have power only over externals virtuewhich alone is truly good rests entirely with the individual therefore every man has perfectfreedom provided he emancipates himself from mundane desires it is only through falsejudgements that such desires prevail the sage whose judgements are true is master of his fate inall that he values since no outside force can deprive him of virtue there are obvious logical difficulties about this doctrine if virtue is really the sole good abeneficent providence must be solely concerned to cause virtue yet the laws of nature haveproduced abundance of sinners if virtue is the sole good there can be no reason against crueltyand injustice since as the stoics are never tired of pointing out cruelty and injustice afford thesufferer the best opportunities for the exercise of virtue if the world is completely deterministicnatural laws will decide whether i shall be virtuous or not if i am wicked nature compels me tobe wicked and the freedom which virtue is supposed to give is not possible for me to a modern mind it is difficult to feel enthusiastic about a virtuous life if nothing is going to beachieved by it we admire a medical man who risks his life in an epidemic of plague because wethink illness is an evil and we hope to diminish its frequency but if illness is no evil the medicalman might as well stay comfortably at home to the stoic his virtue is an end in itself notsomething that does good and when we take a longer view what is the ultimate outcome adestruction of the present world by fire and then a repetition of the whole process could anythingbe more devastatingly futile there may be progress here and there for a time but in the long runthere is only recurrence when we see something unbearably painful we hope that in time suchthings will cease to happen but the stoic assures us that what is happening now will happen overand over again providence which sees the whole must one would think ultimately grow wearythrough despair there goes with this a certain coldness in the stoic conception of virtue not only bad passions arecondemned but all passions the sage does not feel sympathy when his wife or his children diehe 
upon himself he may become poor but what of it he can still be virtuous a tyrant may put himin prison but he can still persevere in living in harmony with nature he may be sentenced todeath but he can die nobly like socrates other men have power only over externals virtuewhich alone is truly good rests entirely with the individual therefore every man has perfectfreedom provided he emancipates himself from mundane desires it is only through falsejudgements that such desires prevail the sage whose judgements are true is master of his fate inall that he values since no outside force can deprive him of virtue there are obvious logical difficulties about this doctrine if virtue is really the sole good abeneficent providence must be solely concerned to cause virtue yet the laws of nature haveproduced abundance of sinners if virtue is the sole good there can be no reason against crueltyand injustice since as the stoics are never tired of pointing out cruelty and injustice afford thesufferer the best opportunities for the exercise of virtue if the world is completely deterministicnatural laws will decide whether i shall be virtuous or not if i am wicked nature compels me tobe wicked and the freedom which virtue is supposed to give is not possible for me to a modern mind it is difficult to feel enthusiastic about a virtuous life if nothing is going to beachieved by it we admire a medical man who risks his life in an epidemic of plague because wethink illness is an evil and we hope to diminish its frequency but if illness is no evil the medicalman might as well stay comfortably at home to the stoic his virtue is an end in itself notsomething that does good and when we take a longer view what is the ultimate outcome adestruction of the present world by fire and then a repetition of the whole process could anythingbe more devastatingly futile there may be progress here and there for a time but in the long runthere is only recurrence when we see something unbearably painful we hope that in time suchthings will cease to happen but the stoic assures us that what is happening now will happen overand over again providence which sees the whole must one would think ultimately grow wearythrough despair there goes with this a certain coldness in the stoic conception of virtue not only bad passions arecondemned but all passions the sage does not feel sympathy when his wife or his children diehe reflects that this event is no obstacle to his own virtue and therefore he does not suffer deeply friendship so highly prized by epicurus is all very well but it must not be carried to the pointwhere your friends misfortunes can destroy your holy calm as for public life it may be yourduty to engage in it since it gives opportunities for justice fortitude and so on but you mustnot be actuated by a desire to benefit mankind since the benefits you can confersuch as peaceor a more adequate supply of foodare no true benefits and in any case nothing matters to youexcept your own virtue the stoic is not virtuous in order to do good but does good in order tobe virtuous it has not occurred to him to love his neighbour as himself love except in asuperficial sense is absent from his conception of virtue when i say this i am thinking of love as an emotion not as a principle as a principle the stoics preached universal love this principle is found in seneca and his successors andprobably was taken by them from earlier stoics the logic of the school led to doctrines whichwere softened by the humanity of its adherents who were much better men than they wouldhave been if they had been consistent kantwho resembles themsays that you must be kindto your brother not because you are fond of him but because the moral law enjoins kindness idoubt however whether in private life he lived down to this precept leaving these generalities let us come to the history of stoicism of zeno only some fragments remain from these it appears that he defined god as the fierymind of the world that he said god was a bodily substance and that the whole universe formedthe substance of god tertullian says that according to zeno god runs through the materialworld as honey runs through the honeycomb according to diogenes laertius zeno held thatthe general law which is right reason pervading everything is the same as zeus the supreme head of the government of the universe god mind destiny zeus are one thing destiny is a power which moves matter providence and nature are other names for it zenodoes not believe that there should be temples to the gods to build temples there will be noneed for a temple must not be held a thing of great worth or anything holy nothing can be ofgreat worth or holy which  for the sources of what follows see bevan later greek religion p ff

of causes was from eternity spinning the thread of thy being there goes with this in spite of hisposition in the roman state the stoic belief in the human race as one community my city andcountry so far as i am antoninus is rome but so far as i am a man it is the world there is thedifficulty that one finds in all stoics of reconciling determinism with the freedom of the willmen exist for the sake of one another he says when he is thinking of his duty as ruler thewickedness of one man does no harm to another he says on the same page when he is thinkingof the doctrine that the virtuous will alone is good he never inferred that the goodness of one mandoes no good to another and that he would do no harm to anybody but himself if he were as badan emperor as nero and yet this conclusion seems to follow it is peculiar to man he says to love even those who do wrong and this happens if when theydo wrong it occurs to thee that they are kinsmen and that they do wrong through ignorance andunintentionally and that soon both of you will die and above all that the wrongdoer has donethee no harm for he has not made thy ruling faculty worse than it was before and again love mankind follow god  and it is enough to remember that law rules all these passages bring out very clearly the inherent contradictions in stoic ethics and theology onthe one hand the universe is a rigidly deterministic single whole in which all that happens is theresult of previous causes on the other hand the individual will is completely autonomous and noman can be forced to sin by outside causes this is one contradiction and there is a second closelyconnected with it since the will is autonomous and the virtuous will alone is good one mancannot do either good or harm to another therefore benevolence is an illusion something must besaid about each of these contradictions the contradiction between free will and determinism is one of those that run through philosophyfrom early times to our own day taking different forms at different times at present it is the stoicform that concerns us i think that a stoic if we could make him submit to a socratic interrogation would defend hisview more or less as follows the universe is a single animate being having a soul which mayalso be called god or reason as a whole this being is free god decided from the first that he wouldact according to fixed general laws but he chose such laws as would have the best results sometimes in particular cases the results are not wholly desirable but this inconvenience isworth enduring as in human codes of law for the sake of the advantage of legislative fixity ahuman being is partly fire partly of lower clay in so far as he is fire he is part of god when the divine part of a man exercises will virtuously this willis part of gods which is free therefore in these circumstances the human will also is free this is a good answer up to a point but it breaks down when we consider the causes of ourvolitions we all know as a matter of empirical fact that dyspepsia for example has a bad effecton a mans virtue and that by suitable drugs forcibly administered willpower can be destroyed take epictetuss favorite case the man unjustly imprisoned by a tyrant of which there have beenmore examples in recent years than at any other period in human history some of these men haveacted with stoic heroism some rather mysteriously have not it has become clear not only thatsufficient torture will break down almost any mans fortitude but also that morphia or cocaine canreduce a man to docility the will in fact is only independent of the tyrant so long as the tyrant isunscientific this is an extreme example but the same arguments that exist in favour ofdeterminism in the inanimate world exist also in the sphere of human volitions in general i do notsayi do not thinkthat these arguments are conclusive i say only that they are of equal strengthin both cases and that there can be no good reason for accepting them in one region and rejectingthem in another the stoic when he is engaged in urging a tolerant attitude to sinners willhimself urge that the sinful will is a result of previous causes it is only the virtuous will thatseems to him free this however is inconsistent marcus aurelius explains his own virtue as dueto the good influence of parents grandparents and teachers the good will is just as much a resultof previous causes as the bad will the stoic may say truly that his philosophy is a cause of virtuein those who adopt it but it seem that it will not have this desirable effect unless there is a certainadmixture of intellectual error the realization that virtue and sin alike are the 
called god or reason as a whole this being is free god decided from the first that he wouldact according to fixed general laws but he chose such laws as would have the best results sometimes in particular cases the results are not wholly desirable but this inconvenience isworth enduring as in human codes of law for the sake of the advantage of legislative fixity ahuman being is partly fire partly of lower clay in so far as he is fire he is part of god when the divine part of a man exercises will virtuously this willis part of gods which is free therefore in these circumstances the human will also is free this is a good answer up to a point but it breaks down when we consider the causes of ourvolitions we all know as a matter of empirical fact that dyspepsia for example has a bad effecton a mans virtue and that by suitable drugs forcibly administered willpower can be destroyed take epictetuss favorite case the man unjustly imprisoned by a tyrant of which there have beenmore examples in recent years than at any other period in human history some of these men haveacted with stoic heroism some rather mysteriously have not it has become clear not only thatsufficient torture will break down almost any mans fortitude but also that morphia or cocaine canreduce a man to docility the will in fact is only independent of the tyrant so long as the tyrant isunscientific this is an extreme example but the same arguments that exist in favour ofdeterminism in the inanimate world exist also in the sphere of human volitions in general i do notsayi do not thinkthat these arguments are conclusive i say only that they are of equal strengthin both cases and that there can be no good reason for accepting them in one region and rejectingthem in another the stoic when he is engaged in urging a tolerant attitude to sinners willhimself urge that the sinful will is a result of previous causes it is only the virtuous will thatseems to him free this however is inconsistent marcus aurelius explains his own virtue as dueto the good influence of parents grandparents and teachers the good will is just as much a resultof previous causes as the bad will the stoic may say truly that his philosophy is a cause of virtuein those who adopt it but it seem that it will not have this desirable effect unless there is a certainadmixture of intellectual error the realization that virtue and sin alike are the inevitable result of previous causes is likely to have a somewhatparalysing effect on moral effort i come now to the second contradiction that the stoic while he preached benevolence held intheory that no man can do either good or harm to another since the virtuous will alone is goodand the virtuous will is independent of outside causes this contradiction is more patent than theother and more peculiar to the stoics the explanation oftheir not noticing it is that like many other people they had two systems of ethics a superfine onefor themselves and an inferior one for the lesser breeds without the law when the stoicphilosopher is thinking of himself he holds that happiness and all other worldly socalled goodsare worthless he even says that to desire happiness is contrary to nature meaning that it involveslack of resignation to the will of god but as a practical man administering the roman empire marcus aurelius knows perfectly well that this sort of thing wont do it is his duty to see that thegrainships from africa duly reach rome that measures are taken to relieve the sufferings causedby pestilence and that barbarian enemies are not allowed to cross the frontier that is to say indealing with those of his subjects whom he does not regard as stoic philosophers actual orpotential he accepts ordinary mundane standards of what is good or bad it is by applying thesestandards that he arrives at his duty as an administrator what is odd is that this duty itself is inthe higher sphere of what the stoic sage should do although it is deduced from an ethic which the stoic sage regards as fundamentally mistaken the only reply that i can imagine to this difficulty is one which is perhaps logically unassailablebut is not very plausible it would i think be given by kant whose ethical system is very similarto that of the stoics true he might say there is nothing good but the good will but the will isgood when it is directed to certain ends that in themselves are indifferent it does not matterwhether mr a is happy or unhappy but i if i am virtuous shall act in a way which i believe willmake him happy because that is what the moral law enjoins i cannot make mr a virtuousbecause his virtue depends only upon himself but i can do something towards making him happyor rich or learned or healthy the stoic ethic may therefore be stated as follows certain thingsare vulgarly considered goods 
inevitable result of previous causes is likely to have a somewhatparalysing effect on moral effort i come now to the second contradiction that the stoic while he preached benevolence held intheory that no man can do either good or harm to another since the virtuous will alone is goodand the virtuous will is independent of outside causes this contradiction is more patent than theother and more peculiar to the stoics the explanation oftheir not noticing it is that like many other people they had two systems of ethics a superfine onefor themselves and an inferior one for the lesser breeds without the law when the stoicphilosopher is thinking of himself he holds that happiness and all other worldly socalled goodsare worthless he even says that to desire happiness is contrary to nature meaning that it involveslack of resignation to the will of god but as a practical man administering the roman empire marcus aurelius knows perfectly well that this sort of thing wont do it is his duty to see that thegrainships from africa duly reach rome that measures are taken to relieve the sufferings causedby pestilence and that barbarian enemies are not allowed to cross the frontier that is to say indealing with those of his subjects whom he does not regard as stoic philosophers actual orpotential he accepts ordinary mundane standards of what is good or bad it is by applying thesestandards that he arrives at his duty as an administrator what is odd is that this duty itself is inthe higher sphere of what the stoic sage should do although it is deduced from an ethic which the stoic sage regards as fundamentally mistaken the only reply that i can imagine to this difficulty is one which is perhaps logically unassailablebut is not very plausible it would i think be given by kant whose ethical system is very similarto that of the stoics true he might say there is nothing good but the good will but the will isgood when it is directed to certain ends that in themselves are indifferent it does not matterwhether mr a is happy or unhappy but i if i am virtuous shall act in a way which i believe willmake him happy because that is what the moral law enjoins i cannot make mr a virtuousbecause his virtue depends only upon himself but i can do something towards making him happyor rich or learned or healthy the stoic ethic may therefore be stated as follows certain thingsare vulgarly considered goods but this is a mistake what is good is a will directed towards securing these false goods for otherpeople this doctrine involves no logical contradiction but it loses all plausibility if wegenuinely believe that what are commonly considered goods are worthless for in that case thevirtuous will might just as well be directed to quite other ends there is in fact an element of sour grapes in stoicism we cant be happy but we can be goodlet us therefore pretend that so long as we are good it doesnt matter being unhappy thisdoctrine is heroic and in a bad world useful but it is neither quite true nor in a fundamentalsense quite sincere although the main importance of the stoics was ethical there were two respects in which theirteaching bore fruit in other fields one of these is theory of knowledge the other is the doctrineof natural law and natural rights in theory of knowledge in spite of plato they accepted perception the deceptiveness of thesenses they held was really false judgement and could be avoided by a little care a stoicphilosopher sphaerus an immediate disciple of zeno was once invited to dinner by king ptolemy who having heard of this doctrine offered him a pomegranate made of wax thephilosopher proceeded to try to eat it whereupon the king laughed at him he replied that hehad felt no certainty of its being a real pomegranate but had thought it unlikely that anythinginedible would be supplied at the royal table in this answer he appealed to a stoic distinctionbetween those things which can be known with certainty on the basis of perception and thosewhich on this basis are only probable on the whole this doctrine was sane and scientific another doctrine of theirs in theory of knowledge was more influential though morequestionable this was their belief in innate ideas and principles greek logic was whollydeductive and this raised the question of first premisses first premisses had to be at least inpart general and no method existed of proving them the stoics held that there are certainprinciples which are luminously obvious and are admitted by all men these could be made asin euclid elements the basis of deduction innate ideas similarly could be used as the startingpoint of definitions this point of view was accepted throughout the middle ages and even by descartes  diogenes laertius vol vii p  
but this is a mistake what is good is a will directed towards securing these false goods for otherpeople this doctrine involves no logical contradiction but it loses all plausibility if wegenuinely believe that what are commonly considered goods are worthless for in that case thevirtuous will might just as well be directed to quite other ends there is in fact an element of sour grapes in stoicism we cant be happy but we can be goodlet us therefore pretend that so long as we are good it doesnt matter being unhappy thisdoctrine is heroic and in a bad world useful but it is neither quite true nor in a fundamentalsense quite sincere although the main importance of the stoics was ethical there were two respects in which theirteaching bore fruit in other fields one of these is theory of knowledge the other is the doctrineof natural law and natural rights in theory of knowledge in spite of plato they accepted perception the deceptiveness of thesenses they held was really false judgement and could be avoided by a little care a stoicphilosopher sphaerus an immediate disciple of zeno was once invited to dinner by king ptolemy who having heard of this doctrine offered him a pomegranate made of wax thephilosopher proceeded to try to eat it whereupon the king laughed at him he replied that hehad felt no certainty of its being a real pomegranate but had thought it unlikely that anythinginedible would be supplied at the royal table in this answer he appealed to a stoic distinctionbetween those things which can be known with certainty on the basis of perception and thosewhich on this basis are only probable on the whole this doctrine was sane and scientific another doctrine of theirs in theory of knowledge was more influential though morequestionable this was their belief in innate ideas and principles greek logic was whollydeductive and this raised the question of first premisses first premisses had to be at least inpart general and no method existed of proving them the stoics held that there are certainprinciples which are luminously obvious and are admitted by all men these could be made asin euclid elements the basis of deduction innate ideas similarly could be used as the startingpoint of definitions this point of view was accepted throughout the middle ages and even by descartes  diogenes laertius vol vii p  the doctrine of natural right as it appears in the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth centuriesis a revival of a stoic doctrine though with important modifications it was the stoics whodistinguished jus naturale from jus gentium natural law was derived from first principles of thekind held to underlie all general knowledge by nature the stoics held all human beings areequal marcus aurelius in his meditations favours a polity in which there is the same law forall a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech and a kinglygovernment which respects most of all the freedom of the governed this was an ideal whichcould not be consistently realized in the roman empire but it influenced legislation particularlyin improving the status of women and slaves christianity took over this part of stoic teachingalong with much of the rest and when at last in the seventeenth century the opportunity came tocombat despotism effectually the stoic doctrines of natural law and natural equality in their christian dress acquired a practical force which in antiquity not even an emperor could give tothem chapter xxix the roman empire in relation to culture t he roman empire affected the history of culture in various more or less separate ways first there is the direct effect of rome on hellenistic thought this is not very important orprofound second the effect of greece and the east on the western half of the empire this was profoundand lasting since it included the christian religion third the importance of the long roman peace in diffusing culture

i come now to the four ways in which the roman empire affected the history of culture i the direct effect of rome on greek thought this begins in the second century bc withtwo men the historian polybius and the stoic philosopher panaetius the natural attitude of the greek to the roman was one of contempt mingled with fear the greek felt himself morecivilized but politically less powerful if the romans were more successful in politics that onlyshowed that politics is an ignoble pursuit the average greek of the second century bc waspleasureloving quickwitted clever in business and unscrupulous in all things there werehowever still men of philosophic capacity some of thesenotably the sceptics such as carneadeshad allowed cleverness to destroy seriousness some like the epicureans and a sectionof the stoics had withdrawn wholly into a quiet private life but a few with more insight than hadbeen shown by aristotle in relation to alexander realized that the greatness of rome was due tocertain merits which were lacking among the greeks the historian polybius born in arcadia about bc was sent to rome as a prisoner and therehad the good fortune to become the friend of the younger scipio whom he accompanied on manyof his campaigns it was uncommon for a greek to know latin though most educated romansknew greek the circumstances of polybius however led him to a thorough familiarity with latin he wrote for the benefit of the greeks the history of the punic wars which had enabled rome toconquer the world his admiration of the roman constitution was becoming out of date while hewrote but until his time it had compared very favorably in stability and efficiency with thecontinually changing constitutions of most greek cities the romans naturally read his historywith pleasure whether the greeks did so is more doubtful panaetius the stoic has been already considered in the preceding chapter he was a friend of polybius and like him a protg of the younger scipio while scipio lived he wasfrequently in rome but after scipios death in bc he stayed in athens as head of the stoicschool rome still had what greece had lost the hopefulness connected with the opportunity forpolitical activity accordingly the doctrines of panaetius were more political and less akin tothose of the cynics than were those of earlier stoics probably the admiration of plato felt by cultivated romans influenced him in abandoning the dogmatic narrowness of his stoic predecessors in thebroader form given to it by him and by his successor posidonius stoicism strongly appealed to themore serious among the romans at a later date epictetus though a greek lived most of his life in rome rome supplied him withmost of his illustrations he is always exhorting the wise man not to tremble in the presence of the emperor we know the influence of epictetus on marcus aurelius but his influence on the greeks is hard to trace plutarch in his lives of the noble grecians and romans traced a parallelismbetween the most eminent men of the two countries he spent a considerable time in rome andwas honoured by the emperors hadrian and trajan in addition to his lives he wrote numerousworks on philosophy religion natural history and morals his lives are obviously concerned toreconcile greece and rome in mans thoughts on the whole apart from such exceptional men rome acted as a blight on the greekspeakingpart of the empire thought and art alike declined until the end of the second century ad lifefor the welltodo was pleasant and easygoing there was no incentive to strenuousness and littleopportunity for great achievement the recognized schools of philosophythe academy the peripatetics the epicureans and the stoicscontinued to exist until they were closed by justinianfrom christian bigotry in the year ad none of these however showed any vitalitythroughout the time after marcus aurelius except the neoplatonists in the third century adwhom we shall consider in the next chapter and these men were hardly at all influenced by rome the latin and greek halves of the empire became more and more divergent the knowledge of greek became rare in the west and after constantine latin in the east survived only in law and inthe army ii the influence of greece and the east in rome there are here two very different things toconsider first the influence of hellenic art and literature and philosophy on the most cultivated romans second the spread of non hellenic religions and superstitions throughout the westernworld when the romans first came in contact with greeks they

all this so great sprung from that greatness not to answer thus could only be to have neitherfathomed this world nor had any vision of that other there is another reason for rejecting the gnostic view the gnostics think that nothing divine isassociated with the sun moon and stars they were created by an evil spirit only the soul of manamong things perceived has any goodness but plotinus is firmly persuaded that the heavenlybodies are the bodies of godlike beings immeasurably superior to man according to the gnostics their own soul the soul of the least of mankind they declare deathless divine but theentire heavens and the stars within the heavens have had no communion with the immortal principle though these are far purer and lovelier than their own souls for the view of plotinus there is authority in the timaeus and it was adopted by some christian fathers forinstance origen it is imaginatively attractive it expresses feelings that the heavenly bodiesnaturally inspire and makes man less lonely in the physical universe there is in the mysticism of plotinus nothing morose or hostile to beauty but he is the lastreligious teacher for many centuries of whom this can be said beauty and all the pleasuresassociated with it came to be thought to be of the devil pagans as well as christians came toglorify ugliness and dirt julian the apostate like contemporary orthodox saints boasted of thepopulousness of his beard of all this there is nothing in plotinus matter is created by soul and has no independent reality every soul has its hour when thatstrikes it descends and enters the body suitable to it the motive is not reason but somethingmore analogous to sexual desire when the soul leaves the body it must enter another body if ithas been sinful for justice requires that it should be punished if in this life you have murderedyour mother you will in the next life be a woman and be murdered by your son sinmust be punished but the punishment happens naturally through the restless driving of thesinners errors do we remember this life after we are dead the answer is perfectly logical but not what mostmodern theologians would say memory is concerned with our life in time whereas our best andtruest life is in eternity therefore as the soul grows towards eternal life it will remember less and less friends children wife will be gradually forgotten ultimatelywe shall know nothing of the things of this world but only contemplate the intellectual realm there will be no memory of personality which in contemplative vision is unaware of itself thesoul will become one with nous but not to its own destruction nous and the individual soul willbe simultaneously two and one in the fourth ennead which is on the soul one section the seventh tractate is devoted to thediscussion of immortality the body being compound is clearly not immortal if then it is part of us we are not whollyimmortal but what is the relation of the soul to the body aristotle said the soul was the form of the body but plotinus rejects this view on the groundthat the intellectual act would be impossible if the soul were any form of body the stoics thinkthat the soul is material but the unity of the soul proves that this is impossible moreover sincematter is passive it cannot have created itself matter could not exist if soul had not created itand if soul did not exist matter would disappear in a twinkling the soul is neither matter nor theform of a material body but essence and essence is eternal this view is implicit in platosargument that the soul is immortal because ideas are eternal but it is only with plotinus that itbecomes explicit how does the soul enter the body from the aloofness of the intellectual world the answer isthrough appetite but appetite though sometimes ignoble may be comparatively noble at bestthe soul has the desire of elaborating order on the model of what it has seen in the intellectual principle that is to say soul contemplates the inward realm of essence and wishes toproduce something as like it as possible that can be seen by looking without instead of lookingwithinlike a composer who first imagines his music and then wishes to hear itperformed by an orchestra but this desire of the soul to create has unfortunate results so long as the soul lives in the pureworld of essence it is not separated from other souls living in the same world but as soon as itbecomes joined to a body it has the task of governing what is lower than itself and by this task itbecomes separate from other souls which have other bodies except in a few men at a fewmoments the soul becomes

for only the thing with which all power ends fails to pass downwards something of itself this is perhaps the best answer to the gnostics that the principles of plotinus make possible theproblem in slightly different language was inherited by christian theologians they also havefound it difficult to account for the creation without allowing the blasphemous conclusion thatbefore it something was lacking to the creator indeed their difficulty is greater than that of plotinus for he may say that the nature of mind made creation inevitable whereas for the christian the world resulted from the untrammelled exercise of gods free will plotinus has a very vivid sense of a certain kind of abstract beauty in describing the position of intellect as intermediate between the one and soul he suddenly bursts out into a passage of rareeloquence the supreme in its progress could never be borne forward upon some soulless vehicle nor evendirectly upon the soul it will be heralded by some ineffable beauty before the great king in hisprogress there comes first the minor train then rank by rank the greater and more exalted closerto the king the kinglier next his own honoured company until last among all these grandeurssuddenly appears the supreme monarch himself and allunless indeed for those who havecontented themselves with the spectacle before his coming and gone awayprostrate themselvesand hail him there is a tractate on intellectual beauty which shows the same kind of feeling assuredly all the gods are august and beautiful in a beauty beyond our speech and what makesthem so intellect and especially intellect operating within them tovisibility  to live at ease is there and to these divine beings verity is mother and nurse existence andsustenance all that is not of process but of authentic being they see and themselves in all for allis transparent nothing dark nothing resistant every being is lucid to every other in breadth anddepth light runs through light and each of them contains all within itself and at the same timesees all in every other so that everywhere there is all and all is all and each all and infinite the glory each of them is great the small is great the sun there is all thestars and every star again is all the stars and sun while some manner of being is dominant ineach all are mirrored in every other in addition to the imperfection which the world inevitably possesses because it is a copy there isfor plotinus as for the christians the more positive evil that results from sin sin is a consequenceof free will which plotinus upholds as against the determinists and more particularly theastrologers he does not venture to deny the validity of astrology altogether but he attempts to setbounds to it so as to make what remains compatible with free will he does the same as regardsmagic the sage he says is exempt from the power of the magician porphyry relates that a rivalphilosopher tried to put evil spells on plotinus but that because of his holiness and wisdom thespells recoiled on the rival porphyry and all the followers of plotinus are much moresuperstitious than he is superstition in him is as slight as was possible in that age let us now endeavor to sum up the merits and defects of the doctrine taught by plotinus and inthe main accepted by christian theology so long as it remained systematic and intellectual there is first and foremost the construction of what plotinus believed to be a secure refuge forideals and hopes and one moreover which involved both moral and intellectual effort in thethird century and in the centuries after the barbarian invasion western civilization came near tototal destruction it was fortunate that while theology was almost the sole surviving mentalactivity the system that was accepted was not purely superstitious but preserved thoughsometimes deeply buried doctrines which embodied much of the work of greek intellect andmuch of the moral devotion that is common to the stoics and the neoplatonists this madepossible the rise of the scholastic philosophy and later with the renaissance the stimulus derivedfrom the renewed study of plato and thence of the other ancients on the other hand the philosophy of plotinus has the defect of encouraging men to look withinrather than to look without when we look within we see nous which is divine while when welook without we see the imperfections of the sensible world this kind of subjectivity was agradual growth it is to be found in the doctrines

accepted as kings who probably had a real existence but at the earliestpoint at which we come to something certainly historical there are already the two kingdoms of israel and judah the first person mentioned in the old testament of whom there is anindependent record is ahab king of israel who is spoken of in an assyrian let

this belief embodied revenge psychology andwas intelligible to all and sundry as the doctrines of greek philosophers were not to understand the origin of these beliefs we must take account of certain facts in jewishhistory to which we will now turn our attention the early history of the israelites cannot be confirmed from any source outside the old testament and it is impossible to know at what point it ceases to be purely legendary davidand solomon may be accepted as kings who probably had a real existence but at the earliestpoint at which we come to something certainly historical there are already the two kingdoms of israel and judah the first person mentioned in the old testament of whom there is anindependent record is ahab king of israel who is spoken of in an assyrian let ter of bc the assyrians finally conquered the northern kingdom in bc andremoved a great part of the population after this time the kingdom of judah alone preservedthe israelite religion and tradition the kingdom of judah just survived the assyrians whosepower came to an end with the capture of nineveh by the babylonians and medes in bcbut in bc nebuchadrezzar captured jerusalem destroyed the temple and removed alarge part of the population to babylon the babylonian kingdom fell in bc when babylon was taken by cyrus king of the medes and persians cyrus in bc issued anedict allowing the jews to return to palestine many of them did so under the leadership of nehemiah and ezra the temple was rebuilt and jewish orthodoxy began to be crystallized in the period of the captivity and for some time before and after this period jewish religionwent through a very important development originally there appears to have been not verymuch difference from a religious point of view between the israelites and surrounding tribes yahweh was at first only a tribal god who favoured the children of israel but it was not deniedthat there were other gods and their worship was habitual when the first commandment saysthou shalt have none other gods but me it is saying something which was an innovation inthe time immediately preceding the captivity this is made evident by various texts in theearlier prophets it was the prophets at this time who first taught that the worship of heathengods was sin to win the victory in the constant wars of that time they proclaimed the favourof yahweh was essential and yahweh would withdraw his favour if other gods were alsohonoured jeremiah and ezekiel especially seem to have invented the idea that all religionsexcept one are false and that the lord punishes idolatry some quotations will illustrate their teachings and the prevalence of the heathen practicesagainst which they protested seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in thestreets of jerusalem the children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the womenknead their dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven ishtar and to pour out drinkofferings unto other

but the greek nation was too full of youthful vigour for the general acceptance of a belief whichdenies this world and transfers real life to the beyond accordingly the orphic doctrine remainedconfined to the relatively narrow circle of the initiate without acquiring the smallest influence onthe state religion not even in communities which like athens had taken up the celebration of themysteries into the state ritual and placed it under legal protection a full millennium was to passbefore these ideasin a quite different theological dress it is trueachieved victory in the greekworld it would seem that this is an overstatement particularly as regards the eleusinian mysteries whichwere impregnated with orphism broadly speaking those who were of a religious temperamentturned to orphism while rationalists despised it one might compare its status to that of methodism in england in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries we know more or less what an educated greek learnt from his father but we know very little ofwhat in his earliest years he learnt from his mother who was to a great extent shut out from thecivilization in which the men took delight it seems probable that educated athenians even in thebest period however rationalistic they may have been in their explicitly conscious mentalprocesses retained from tradition and from childhood a more primitive way of thinking andfeeling which was always liable to prove victorious in times of stress for this reason no simpleanalysis of the greek outlook is likely to be adequate the influence of religion more particularly of non olympian religion on greek thought was notadequately recognized until recent times a revolutionary book jane harrison prolegomena tothe study of greek religion emphasized both the primitive and the dionysiac elements in thereligion of ordinary greeks f m cornfords from religion to philosophy tried to make studentsof greek philosophy aware of the influence of religion on the philosophers but cannot be whollyaccepted as trustworthy in many of its interpretations or for that matter in its anthropology themost balanced statement known to me is in john burnet early greek philosophy especially chapter ii science and religion a conflict between science and religion arose he says out ofthe religious revival which swept over hellas in the sixth century bc together with the shifting of the scene from ionia tothe west the religion of continental hellas he says had developed in a very different wayfrom that of ionia in particular the worship of dionysus which came from thrace and is barelymentioned in homer contained in germ a wholly new way of looking at mans relation to theworld it would certainly be wrong to credit the thracians themselves with any very exaltedviews but there can be no doubt that to the greeks the phenomenon of ecstasy suggested that thesoul was something more than a feeble double of the self and that it was only when out of thebody that it could show its true nature  it looked as if greek religion were about to enter on the same stage as that already reached by thereligions of the east and but for the rise of science it is hard to see what could have checked thistendency it is usual to say that the greeks were saved from a religion of the oriental type by theirhaving no priesthood but this is to mistake the effect for the cause priesthoods do not makedogmas though they preserve them once they are made and in the earlier stages of theirdevelopment the oriental peoples had no priesthoods either in the sense intended it was not somuch the absence of a priesthood as the existence of the scientific schools that saved greece the new religionfor in one sense it was new though in another as old as mankindreached itshighest point of development with the foundation of the orphic communities so far as we cansee the original home of these was attika but they spread with extraordinary rapidity especiallyin southern italy and sicily they were first of all associations for the worship of dionysus butthey were distinguished by two features which were new among the hellenes they looked to arevelation as the source of religious authority and they were organized as artificial communities the poems which contained their theology were ascribed to the thracian orpheus who hadhimself descended into hades and was therefore a safe guide through the perils which beset thedisembodied soul in the next world burnet goes on to state that there is a striking similaritybetween orphic beliefs and those prevalent in india at about the same time though he holds thatthere cannot have been any contact he then comes on to the original meaning of the word orgywhich was used

of the letter of the law it soon ceased to offer scope for the development of such a lofty system ofethics as the testaments of the patriarchs attest and so the true successors of the early hasidsand their teaching quitted judaism and found their natural home in the bosom of primitive christianity after a period of rule by the high priests mark antony made his friend herod king of the jews herod was a gay adventurer often on the verge of bankruptcy accustomed to roman society andvery far removed from jewish piety his wife was of the family of the high priests but he was an iduman which alone would suffice to make him an object of suspicion to the jews he was askilful timeserver and deserted antony promptly when it became evident that octavius was goingto be victorious however he made strenuous attempts to reconcile the jews to his rule he rebuiltthe temple though in a hellenistic style with rows of corinthian pillars but he placed over themain gate a large golden eagle thereby infringing the second commandment when it wasrumoured that he was dying the pharisees pulled down the eagle but he in revenge caused anumber of them to be put to death he died in bc and soon after his death the romansabolished the kingship putting judea under a procurator pontius pilate who became procuratorin ad was tactless and was soon retired in ad the jews led by the party of the zealots rebelled against rome they were defeatedand jerusalem was captured in ad the temple was destroyed and few jews were left in judea the jews of the dispersion had become important centuries before this time the jews had beenoriginally an almost wholly agricultural people but they learnt trading from the babyloniansduring the captivity many of them remained in babylon after the time of ezra and nehemiah andamong these some were very rich after the foundation of alexandria great numbers of jewssettled in that city they had a special quarter assigned to them not as a ghetto but to keep themfrom danger of pollution by contact with gentiles the alexandrian jews became much morehellenized than those of judea and forgot hebrew for this reason it became necessary to translatethe old testament into greek the result was the septuagint the pentateuch was translated in themiddle of the third century bc the other parts somewhat later legends arose about the septuagint so called because it was the work of seventy translators itwas said that each of the seventy translated the whole independently and that when the versionswere compared they were found to be identical down to the smallest detail having all beendivinely inspired nevertheless later scholarship showed that the septuagint was gravelydefective the jews after the rise of christianity made little use of it but reverted to reading the old testament in hebrew the early christians on the contrary few of whom knew hebrewdepended upon the septuagint or upon translations from it into latin a better text was producedby the labours of origen in the third century but those who only knew latin had very defectiveversions until jerome in the fifth century produced the vulgate this was at first received

centuries christianity at first was preached by jews to jews as a reformed judaism saint james andto a lesser extent saint peter wished it to remain no more than this and they might have prevailedbut for saint paul who was determined to admit gentiles without demanding circumcision orsubmission to the mosaic law the contention between the two factions is related in the acts ofthe apostles from a pauline point of view the communities of christians that saint paulestablished in many places were no doubt composed partly of converts from among the jewspartly of gentiles seeking a new religion the certainties of judaism made it attractive in that ageof dissolving faiths but circumcision was an obstacle to the conversion of men the ritual laws inregard to food were also inconvenient these two obstacles even if there had been no otherswould have made it almost impossible for the hebrew religion to become universal christianityowing to saint paul retained what was attractive in the doctrines of the jews without the featuresthat gentiles found hardest to assimilate the view that the jews were the chosen people remained however obnoxious to greek pride this view was radically rejected by the gnostics they or at least some of them held that thesensible world had been created by an inferior deity named ialdabaoth the rebellious son of sophia he they said is the yahweh of the old

chapter ii christianity during the first four centuries christianity at first was preached by jews to jews as a reformed judaism saint james andto a lesser extent saint peter wished it to remain no more than this and they might have prevailedbut for saint paul who was determined to admit gentiles without demanding circumcision orsubmission to the mosaic law the contention between the two factions is related in the acts ofthe apostles from a pauline point of view the communities of christians that saint paulestablished in many places were no doubt composed partly of converts from among the jewspartly of gentiles seeking a new religion the certainties of judaism made it attractive in that ageof dissolving faiths but circumcision was an obstacle to the conversion of men the ritual laws inregard to food were also inconvenient these two obstacles even if there had been no otherswould have made it almost impossible for the hebrew religion to become universal christianityowing to saint paul retained what was attractive in the doctrines of the jews without the featuresthat gentiles found hardest to assimilate the view that the jews were the chosen people remained however obnoxious to greek pride this view was radically rejected by the gnostics they or at least some of them held that thesensible world had been created by an inferior deity named ialdabaoth the rebellious son of sophia he they said is the yahweh of the old testament while the serpentso far from being wicked was engaged in warning eve against his deceptions for a long time thesupreme deity allowed ialdabaoth free play at last he sent his son to inhabit temporarily thebody of the man jesus and to lib erate the world from the false teaching of moses those who held this view combined it as arule with a platonic philosophy plotinus as we saw found some difficulty in refuting it gnosticism afforded a halfway house between philosophic paganism and christianity forwhile it honoured christ it thought ill of the jews the same was true later of manichsmthrough which saint augustine came to the catholic faith manichasm combined christianand zoroastrian elements teaching that evil is a positive principle embodied in matter whilethe good principle is embodied in spirit it condemned meateating and all sex even inmarriage such intermediate doctrines helped much in the gradual conversion of cultivated menof greek speech but the new testament warns true believers against them o timothy keepthat which is committed to thy trust avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions ofscience gnosis falsely so called which some professing have erred concerning the faith gnostics and manichans continued to flourish until the government became christian afterthat time they were led to conceal their beliefs but they still had a subterranean influence oneof the doctrines of a certain sect of gnostics was adopted by mahomet they taught that jesuswas a mere man and that the son of god descended upon him at the baptism and abandonedhim at the time of the passion in support of this view they appealed to the text my god my god why hast thou forsaken me a text which it must be confessed christians havealways found difficult the gnostics considered it unworthy of the son of god to be born to bean infant and above all to die on the cross they said that these things had befallen the man jesus but not the divine son of god mahomet who recognized jesus as a prophet though notas divine had a strong class feeling that prophets ought not to come to a bad end he thereforeadopted the view of the docetics according to which it was a mere phantomthat hung upon the cross upon which impotently and ignorantly jews and romans wreakedtheir ineffectual vengeance in this way something of gnosticism passed over into the orthodoxdoctrine of islam the attitude of christians to contemporary jews early became hostile the received view wasthat god had spoken to the patriarchs  i timothy vi  mark xxv  
erate the world from the false teaching of moses those who held this view combined it as arule with a platonic philosophy plotinus as we saw found some difficulty in refuting it gnosticism afforded a halfway house between philosophic paganism and christianity forwhile it honoured christ it thought ill of the jews the same was true later of manichsmthrough which saint augustine came to the catholic faith manichasm combined christianand zoroastrian elements teaching that evil is a positive principle embodied in matter whilethe good principle is embodied in spirit it condemned meateating and all sex even inmarriage such intermediate doctrines helped much in the gradual conversion of cultivated menof greek speech but the new testament warns true believers against them o timothy keepthat which is committed to thy trust avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions ofscience gnosis falsely so called which some professing have erred concerning the faith gnostics and manichans continued to flourish until the government became christian afterthat time they were led to conceal their beliefs but they still had a subterranean influence oneof the doctrines of a certain sect of gnostics was adopted by mahomet they taught that jesuswas a mere man and that the son of god descended upon him at the baptism and abandonedhim at the time of the passion in support of this view they appealed to the text my god my god why hast thou forsaken me a text which it must be confessed christians havealways found difficult the gnostics considered it unworthy of the son of god to be born to bean infant and above all to die on the cross they said that these things had befallen the man jesus but not the divine son of god mahomet who recognized jesus as a prophet though notas divine had a strong class feeling that prophets ought not to come to a bad end he thereforeadopted the view of the docetics according to which it was a mere phantomthat hung upon the cross upon which impotently and ignorantly jews and romans wreakedtheir ineffectual vengeance in this way something of gnosticism passed over into the orthodoxdoctrine of islam the attitude of christians to contemporary jews early became hostile the received view wasthat god had spoken to the patriarchs  i timothy vi  mark xxv  and prophets who were holy men and had foretold the coming of christ but when christcame the jews failed to recognize him and were thenceforth to be accounted wicked moreover christ had abrogated the mosaic law substituting the two commandments to love god and our neighbour this also the jews

specially noted for one wise saying his according to tradition was water is best according to aristotle he thought that water is the original substance out of which all othersare formed and he maintained that the earth rests on water aristotle also says of him that hesaid the magnet has a soul in it because it moves the iron further that all things are full ofgods the statement that everything is made of water is to be regarded as a scientific hypothesis andby no means a foolish one twenty years ago the received view was that everything is made ofhydrogen which is two thirds of water the greeks were rash in their hypotheses but the milesian school at least was prepared to test them empirically too little is known of thales tomake it possible to reconstruct him at all satisfactorily but of his successors in miletus muchmore is known and it is reasonable to suppose that something of their outlook came from him his science and his philosophy were both crude but they were such as to stimulate both thoughtand observation there are many legends about him but i do not think more is known than the few facts i havementioned some of the stories are pleasant for instance the one told by aristotle in his politics he was reproached for his poverty which was supposed to show thatphilosophy is of no use according to the story he knew by his skill in the stars while it was yetwinter that there would be a great harvest of olives in the coming year so having a littlemoney he gave deposits for the use of all the olivepresses in chios and miletus which hehired at a low price because no one bid against him when the harvest time came and manywere wanted all at once and of a sudden he let them out at any rate which he pleased and madea quantity of money thus he showed the world that philosophers can easily be rich if they likebut that their ambition is of another sort anaximander the second philosopher of the milesian school is much more interesting than thales his dates are uncertain but he was said to have been sixtyfour years old in bcand there is reason to suppose that this is somewhere near the truth he held that all things comefrom a single primal substance but that it is not water as thales held or any other of thesubstances that we know it is infinite eternal  burnet questions this last saying and ageless and it encompasses all the worldsfor he thought our world only one of many theprimal substance is transformed into the various substances with which we are familiar and theseare transformed into each other as to this he makes an important and remarkable statement into that from which things take their rise they pass away once more as is ordained for theymake reparation and satisfaction to one another for their injustice according to the ordering oftime the idea of justice both cosmic and human played a part in greek religion and philosophy whichis not altogether easy for a modern to understand indeed our word justice hardly expresses whatis meant but it is difficult to find any other word that would be preferable the thought which anaximander is expressing seems to be this there should be a certain proportion of fire of earthand of water in the world but each element is perpetually attempting toenlarge its empire but there is a kind of necessity or natural law which perpetually redresses thebalance where there has been fire for example there are ashes which are earth this conceptionof justice of not overstepping eternally fixed boundswas one of the most profound of greekbeliefs the gods were subject to justice just as much as men were but this supreme power wasnot itself personal and was not a supreme god anaximander had an argument to prove that the primal substance could not be water or any otherknown element if one of these were primal it would conquer the others aristotle reports him assaying that these known elements are in opposition to one another air is cold water is moist andfire is hot and therefore if any one of them were infinite the rest would have ceased to be bythis time the primal substance therefore must be neutral in this cosmic strife there was an eternal motion in the course of which was brought about the origin of the worlds the worlds were not created as in jewish or christian theology but evolved there was evolutionalso in the animal kingdom living creatures arose from the moist element as it was evaporated bythe sun man like every other animal was descended from fishes he must be derived fromanimals of a different sort because owing to his long infancy he could not have survivedoriginally as he is now anaximander was full of scientific curiosity he is said to have been

and ageless and it encompasses all the worldsfor he thought our world only one of many theprimal substance is transformed into the various substances with which we are familiar and theseare transformed into each other as to this he makes an important and remarkable statement into that from which things take their rise they pass away once more as is ordained for theymake reparation and satisfaction to one another for their injustice according to the ordering oftime the idea of justice both cosmic and human played a part in greek religion and philosophy whichis not altogether easy for a modern to understand indeed our word justice hardly expresses whatis meant but it is difficult to find any other word that would be preferable the thought which anaximander is expressing seems to be this there should be a certain proportion of fire of earthand of water in the world but each element is perpetually attempting toenlarge its empire but there is a kind of necessity or natural law which perpetually redresses thebalance where there has been fire for example there are ashes which are earth this conceptionof justice of not overstepping eternally fixed boundswas one of the most profound of greekbeliefs the gods were subject to justice just as much as men were but this supreme power wasnot itself personal and was not a supreme god anaximander had an argument to prove that the primal substance could not be water or any otherknown element if one of these were primal it would conquer the others aristotle reports him assaying that these known elements are in opposition to one another air is cold water is moist andfire is hot and therefore if any one of them were infinite the rest would have ceased to be bythis time the primal substance therefore must be neutral in this cosmic strife there was an eternal motion in the course of which was brought about the origin of the worlds the worlds were not created as in jewish or christian theology but evolved there was evolutionalso in the animal kingdom living creatures arose from the moist element as it was evaporated bythe sun man like every other animal was descended from fishes he must be derived fromanimals of a different sort because owing to his long infancy he could not have survivedoriginally as he is now anaximander was full of scientific curiosity he is said to have been the first man who made a map he held that the earth is shaped like a cylinder he is variouslyreported as saying the sun is as large as the earth or twentyseven times as large or twentyeighttimes as large wherever he is original he is scientific and rationalistic anaximenes the last of the milesian triad is not quite so interesting as anaximander but makessome important advances his dates are very uncertain he was certainly subsequent to anaximander and he certainly flourished before bc since in that year miletus wasdestroyed by the persians in the course of their suppression of the ionian revolt the fundamental substance he said is air the soul is air fire is rarefied air when condensed airbecomes first water then if further condensed earth and finally stone this theory has the meritof making all the differences between different substances quantitative depending entirely uponthe degree of condensation he thought that the earth is shaped like a round table and that air encompasses everything justas our soul being air holds us together so do breath and air encompass the whole world itseems that the world breathes anaximenes was more admired in antiquity than anaximander though almost any modern worldwould make the opposite valuation he had an important influence on pythagoras and on muchsubsequent speculation the pythagoreans discovered that the earth is spherical but the atomistsadhered to the view of anaximenes that it is shaped like a disc the milesian school is important not for what it achieved but for what it attempted it wasbrought into existence by the contact of the greek mind with babylonia and egypt miletus was arich commercial city in which primitive prejudices and superstitions were softened by intercoursewith many nations ionia until its subjugation by darius at the beginning of the fifth century wasculturally the most important part of the hellenic world it was almost untouched by the religiousmovement connected with bacchus and orpheus its religion was olympic but seems to havebeen not taken very seriously the speculations of thales anaximander and anaximenes are tobe regarded as scientific hypotheses and seldom show any undue intrusion of anthropomorphicdesires and moral ideas the questions they asked 
and this annoyed theodoric he had reason for fear since italy was catholic and was led bytheological sympathy to side with the emperor he believed rightly or wrongly that there was aplot involving men in his own government this led him to imprison and execute his minister thesenator boethius whose consolations of philosophy was written while he was in prison boethius is a singular figure throughout the middle ages he was read and admired regardedalways as a devout christian and treated almost as if he had been one of the fathers yet his consolations of philosophy written in while he was awaiting execution is purely platonic itdoes not prove that he was not a christian but it does show that pagan philosophy had a muchstronger hold on him then christian theology some theological works especially one on the trinity which are attributed to him are by many authorities considered to be spurious but it wasprobably owing to them that the middle ages were able to regard him as orthodox and to imbibefrom him much platonism which would otherwise have been viewed with suspicion the work is an alternation of verse and prose boethius in his own person speaks in prose while philosophy answers in verse there is at certain resemblance to dante who was no doubtinfluenced by him in the vita nuova the consolations which gibbon rightly calls a golden volume begins by the statement that socrates plato and aristotle are the true philosophers stoics epicureans and the rest areusurpers whom the profane multitude mistook for the friends of philosophy boethius says heobeyed the pythagorean command to follow god happinesswhich is the same thing as blessedness is the good not pleasure friendship is a most sacredthing there is much morality that agrees closely with stoic doctrine and is in fact largely takenfrom seneca there is a summary in verse of the beginning of the timaeus this is followed by agreat deal of purely platonic metaphysics imperfection we are told is a lack implying theexistence of a perfect pattern he adopts the privative theory of evil he then passes on to apantheism which should have shocked christians but for some reason did not blessedness and god he says are both the chiefest good and are therefore identical men are made happy by theobtaining of divinity they who obtain divinity become gods wherefore every one that is happy is a god but by nature there is only one god but there may be many by participation the sumorigin and cause of all that is sought after is rightly thought to be goodness the substance of god consisteth in nothing else but in goodness can god do evil no therefore evil is nothingsince god can do everything virtuous men are always powerful and bad men always weak forboth desire the good but only the virtuous get it the wicked are more unfortunate if they escapepunishment than if they suffer it in wisemen there is no place for hatred the tone of the book is more like that of plato than that of

him a poisoned loaf but benedict miraculously knew it was poisoned he had the habit of givingbread to a certain crow and when the crow came on the day in question the saint said to it inthe name of jesus christ our lord take up that loaf and leave it in some such place where no manmay find it the crow obeyed and on its return was given its usual dinner the wicked priestseeing he could not kill benedicts body decided to kill his soul and sent seven naked youngwomen into the monastery the saint feared lest some of the younger monks might be moved tosin and therefore departed himself that the priest might no longer have a motive for such acts but the priest was killed by the ceiling of his rooms falling on him a monk pursued benedictwith the news rejoicing and bidding him return benedict mourned over the death of the sinnerand imposed a penance on the monk for rejoicing gregory does not only relate miracles but deigns now and then to tell facts in the career of saint benedict after founding twelve monasteries he finally came to monte cassino where there wasa chapel to apollo still used by the country people for heathen worship even to that very timethe mad multitude of infidels did offer most wicked sacrifice benedict destroyed the altarsubstituted a church and converted the neighbouring pagans satan was annoyed the old enemy of mankind not taking this in good part did not now privily or in a dream but inopen sight present himself to the eyes of that holy father and with great outcries complained thathe had offered him violence the noise which he made the monks did hear but himself theycould not see but as the venerable father told them he appeared visibly unto him most fell andcruel and as though with his fiery mouth and flaming eyes he would have torn him in pieceswhat the devil said unto him all the monks did hear for first he would call him by his name andbecause the man of god vouchsafed him not any answer then would he fall a reviling and railingat him for when he cried out calling him blessed bennet and yet found that he gave him noanswer straightways he would turn his tune and say cursed bennet and not blessed what hastthou to do with me and why dost thou thus persecute me here the story ends one gathers that satan gave up in despair i have quoted at some length from these dialogues because they have a threefold importance first they are the principal source for our knowledge of the life of saint benedict whose rule became the model for all westernmonasteries except those of ireland or founded by irishmen secondly they give a vivid pictureof the mental atmosphere among the most civilized people living at the end of the sixth century thirdly they are written by pope gregory the great fourth and last of the doctors of the western church and politically one of the most eminent of the popes to him we must nowturn our attention the venerable w h hutton archdeacon of northampton claims that gregory was thegreatest man of the sixth century the only rival claimants he says would be justinian and saint benedict all three certainly had a profound effect on future ages justinian by his laws benedict by his monastic order and gregory by theincrease of papal power which he brought about in the dialogues that i have been quoting heappears childish and credulous but as a statesman he is astute masterful and very well awareof what can be achieved in the complex and changing world in which he has to operate thecontrast is surprising but the most effective men of action are often intellectually secondrate gregory the great the first pope of that name was born in rome about of a rich andnoble family it seems his grandfather had been pope after he became a widower he himself asa young man had a palace and immense wealth he had what was considered a good educationthough it did not include a knowledge of greek which he never acquired although he lived forsix years in constantinople in he was prefect of the city of rome but religion claimedhim he resigned his office gave his wealth to the founding of monasteries and to charity andturned his own palace into a house for monks himself becoming a benedictine he devotedhimself to meditation and to austerities which permanently injured his health but pope pelagius ii had become aware of his political abilities and sent him as his envoy to constantinople to which since justinians time rome was nominally subject gregory lived in constantinople from to representing papal interests at the emperors court and papaltheology in discussions with eastern ecclesiastics who were always  cambridge medieval history ii chap viii

who lived among them from till his death in the irish in turn did much to evangelize scotland and the north of england in this workthe greatest missionary was saint columba another was saint columban who wrote longletters to gregory on the date of easter and other important questions the conversion of england apart from northumbria was gregorys special care every one knows how before hewas pope he

decreewhich was regarded as heretical not only throughout the west but by a large party in the east this the popes resisted vigorously and successfully at last in under the empress irene the east abandoned the iconoclast heresy meanwhile however events in the westhad put an end forever to the control of byzantium over the papacy in about the year the lombards captured ravenna the capital of byzantine italy this eventwhile it exposed the popes to great danger from the lombards freed them from all dependence onthe greek emperors the popes had preferred the greeks to the lombards for several reasons first the authority of the emperors was legitimate whereas barbarian kings unless recognized bythe emperors were regarded as usurpers second the greeks were civilized third the lombardswere nationalists whereas the church retained roman internationalism fourth the lombards hadbeen arians and some odium still clung to them after their conversion the lombards under king

would say for muslims to decide ueberweg points out that according to the mysticsevery text of the koran had or or layers of interpretation the literal meaning being onlyfor the ignorant vulgar it would seem to follow that a philosophers teaching could not possiblyconflict with the koran for among interpretations there would surely be at least one thatwould fit what the philosopher had to say in the mohammedan world however the ignorantseem to have objected to all learning that went beyond a knowledge of the holy book it wasdangerous even if no specific heresy could be demonstrated the view of the mystics that thepopulace should take the koran literally but wise people need not do so was hardly likely to winwide popular acceptance averroes was concerned to improve the arabic interpretation of aristotle which had been undulyinfluenced by neoplatonism he gave to aristotle the sort of reverence that is given to the founderof a religionmuch more than was given even by avicenna he holds that the existence of godcan be proved by reason independently of revelation a view also held by thomas aquinas asregards immortality he seems to have adhered closely to aristotle maintaining that the soul is notimmortal but intellect is this however does not secure personal immortality sinceintellect is one and the same when manifested in different persons this view naturally wascombated by christian philosophers averroes like most of the later mohammedan philosophers though a believer was not rigidlyorthodox there was a sect of completely orthodox theologians who objected to all philosophy asdeleterious to the faith one of these named algazel wrote a book called destruction of the philosophers pointing out that since all necessary truth is in the koran there is no need ofspeculation independent of revelation averroes replied by a book called destruction of the destruction the religious dogmas that algazel specially upheld against the philosophers were thecreation of the world in time out of nothing the reality of the divine attributes and theresurrection of the body averroes regards religion as containing philosophic truth in allegoricalform this applies in

century four aspects of the twelfth century are specially interesting to us the continued conflict of empire and papacy the rise of the lombard cities the crusades and the growth of scholasticism all these four continued into the following century the crusades gradually came to aninglorious end but as regards the other three movements the thirteenth century marks the culmination of what in the twelfth is in atransitional stage in the thirteenth century the pope definitively triumphed over the emperor the lombard cities acquired secure independence and scholasticism reached its highest point allthis however was an outcome of what the twelfth century had prepared not only the first of these four movements but the other three also are intimately bound up withthe increase of papal and ecclesiastical power the pope was in alliance with the lombard citiesagainst the emperor pope urban ii inaugurated the first crusade and subsequent popes were themain promoters of the later ones the scholastic philosophers were all clerics and church councilstook care to keep them within the bounds of orthodoxy or discipline them if they strayed undoubtedly their sense of the political triumph of the church in which they felt themselvesparticipants stimulated their intellectual initiative one of the curious things about the middle ages is that they were original and creative withoutknowing it all parties justified their policies by antiquarian and archaistic arguments the emperor appealed in germany to the feudal principles of the time of charlemagne in italy to roman law and the power of ancient emperors the lombard cities went still further back to theinstitutions of republican rome the papal party based its claims partly on the forged donation of constantine partly on the relations of saul and samuel as told in the old testament thescholastics appealed either to the scriptures or at first to plato and then to aristotle when theywere original they tried to conceal the fact the crusades were an endeavour to restore the stateof affairs that had existed before the rise of islam we must not be deceived by this literary archaism only in the case of the emperor did itcorrespond

or a benevolent man but as a poet his hymn to the sun written shortly before his deathmight almost have been written by akhnaton the sunworshipper but not quite christianityinforms it though not very obviously he felt a duty to lepers for their sake not for his unlikemost christian saints he was more interested in the happiness of others than in his own salvation he never showed any feeling of superiority even to the humblest or most wicked thomas of celano said of him that he was more than a saint among saints among sinners he was one ofthemselves if satan existed the future of the order founded by saint francis would afford him the mostexquisite gratification the saints immediate successor as head of the order brother eliaswallowed in luxury and allowed a complete abandonment of poverty the chief work of the franciscans in the years immediately following the death of their founder was as recruitingsergeants in the bitter and bloody wars of guelfs and ghibellines the inquisition founded sevenyears after his death was in several countries chiefly conducted by franciscans a smallminority called the spirituals remained true to his teaching many of these were burnt by the inquisition for heresy these men held that christ and the apostles owned no property not eventhe clothes they wore this opinion was condemned as heretical in by john xxii the netresult of saint franciss life was to create yet one more wealthy and corrupt order to strengthenthe hierarchy and to facilitate the persecution of all who excelled in moral earnestness or freedomof thought in view of his own aims and character it is impossible to imagine any more bitterlyironical outcome saint dominic is much less interesting than saint francis he was a castilian andhad like loyola a fanatical devotion to orthodoxy his main purpose was to combat heresy andhe adopted poverty as a means to this end he was present throughout the albigensian war though he is saidto have deplored some of its more extreme atrocities the dominican order was founded in by innocent iii and won quick success the only human trait known to me in saint dominic is hisconfession to jordan of saxony that he liked talking to young women better than to old ones in the order solemnly decreed that this passage should be deleted from jordans life of thefounder the dominicans were even more active than the franciscans in the work of the inquisition theyperformed however a valuable service to mankind by their devotion to learning this was no partof saint dominics intention he had decreed that his friars were not to learn secular sciences orliberal arts except by dispensation this rule was abrogated in after which date everythingwas done to make a studious life easy for dominicans manual labour was no

who had a powerful party in the university the averroists held on the basis oftheir interpretation of aristotle that the soul in so far as it is individual is not immortalimmortality belongs only to the intellect which is impersonal and identical in differentintellectual beings when it was forcibly brought to their notice that this doctrine is contrary to the catholic faith they took refuge in the subterfuge of double truth one sort based on reason inphilosophy and another based on revelation in theology all this brought aristotle into badodour and saint thomas in paris was concerned to undo the harm done by too close adherenceto arabian doctrines in this he was singularly successful aquinas unlike his predecessors had a really competent knowledge of aristotle his friend william of moerbeke provided him with translations from the greek and he himself wrotecommentaries until his time mens notions of aristotle had been obscured by neoplatonicaccretions he however followed the genuine aristotle and disliked platonism even as itappears in saint augustine he succeeded in persuading the church that aristotles system was tobe preferred to platos as the basis of christian philosophy and that mohammedans and christian averroists had misinterpreted aristotle for my part i should say that the de anima leads muchmore naturally to the view of averroes than to that of aquinas however the church since saint thomas has thought otherwise i should say further that aristotles views on most questions oflogic and philosophy were not final and have since been proved to be largely erroneous thisopinion also is not allowed to be professed by any catholic philosopher or teacher of philosophy saint thomass most important work the summa contra gentiles was written during the years it is concerned to establish the truth of the christian religion by arguments addressed toa reader supposed to be not already a christian one gathers that the imaginary reader is usuallythought of as a man versed in the philosophy of the arabs he wrote another book summa theologiae of almost equal importance but of somewhat less interest to us because less designedto use

tion to observation if the world of sense does not fit mathematics so much the worse for theworld of sense in various ways methods of approaching nearer to the mathematicians ideal weresought and the resulting suggestions were the source of much that was mistaken in metaphysicsand theory of knowledge this form of philosophy begins with pythagoras pythagoras as everyone knows said that all things are numbers this statement interpreted in amodern way is logically nonsense but what he meant was not exactly nonsense he discoveredthe importance of numbers in music and the connection which he established between music andarithmetic survives in the mathematical terms harmonic mean and harmonic progression hethought of numbers as shapes as they appear on dice or playing cards we still speak of squaresand cubes of numbers which are terms that we owe to him he also spoke of oblong numberstriangular numbers pyramidal numbers and so on these were the numbers of pebbles required to make the shapes in question he presumably thoughtof the world as atomic and of bodies as built up of molecules composed of atoms arranged invarious shapes in this way he hoped to make arithmetic the fundamental study in physics as inaesthetics the greatest discovery of pythagoras or of his immediate disciples was the proposition aboutrightangled triangles that the sum of the squares on the sides adjoining the right angle is equal tothe square on the remaining side the hypotenuse the egyptians had known that a triangle whosesides are  has a right angle but apparently the greeks were the first to observe that   and acting on this suggestion to discover a proof of the general proposition unfortunately for pythagoras his theorem led at once to the discovery of incommensurableswhich appeared to disprove his whole philosophy in a rightangled isosceles triangle the squareon the hypotenuse is double of the square on either side let us suppose each side an inch longthen how long is the hypotenuse let us suppose its length is mn inches then mn  if mand n have a common factor divide it out then either m or n must be odd now m ntherefore m is even therefore m is even therefore n is odd suppose m p then p ntherefore n p and therefore n is even contra hyp therefore no fraction mn will measure the hypotenuse the above proof issubstantially that in euclid book x this argument proved that whatever unit of length we may adopt there are lengths which bearno exact numerical relation to the unit in the sense that there are no two integers m n such thatm times the length in question is n times the unit this convinced the greek mathematicians thatgeometry must be established independently of arithmetic there are passages in platosdialogues which prove that the independent treatment of geometry was well under way in hisday it is perfected in euclid euclid in book ii proves geometrically many things which weshould naturally prove by algebra such as  a ab b it was because of thedifficulty about incommensurables that he considered this course necessary the same appliesto his treatment of proportion in books v and vi the whole system is logically delightful andanticipates the rigour of nineteenthcentury mathematicians so long as no adequate arithmeticaltheory of incommensurables existed the method of euclid was the best that was possible ingeometry when descartes introduced coordinate geometry thereby again making arithmeticsupreme he assumed the possibility of a solution of the problem of incommensurables thoughin his day no such solution had been found the influence of geometry upon philosophy and scientific method has been profound geometry as established by the greeks starts with axioms which are selfevident and proceeds by deductive reasoning to arrive at theorems that are very far fromselfevident the axioms and theorems are held to be true of actual space which is somethinggiven in experience it thus appeared to be possible to discover things about the actual world byfirst noticing what is selfevident and then using deduction this view influenced plato and kant and most of the intermediate philosophers when the declaration of independence sayswe hold these truths to be selfevident it is modelling itself on euclid the eighteenthcenturydoctrine of natural rights is a search for euclidean axioms in politics the form of newton principia in spite of its admittedly empirical  but not by euclid see heath greek mathematics the above proof was probably knownto plato selfevident was substituted by franklin for jeffersons sacred and undeniable 
let us first consider what is meant by wisdom a man may be wise in some particular pursuitsuch as making houses this implies that he knows the means to some particular end but allparticular ends are subordinate to the end of the universe and wisdom per se is concerned withthe end of the universe now the end of the universe is the good of the intellect ie truth thepursuit of wisdom in this sense is the most perfect sublime profitable and delightful of pursuits all this is proved by appeal to the authority of the philosopher ie aristotle my purpose is to declare the truth which the catholic faith professes but here i musthave recourse to natural reason since the gentiles do not accept the authority of scripture naturalreason however is deficient in the things of god it can prove some parts of the faith but notothers it can prove the existence of god and the immortality of the soul but not the trinity the incarnation or the last judgement whatever is demonstrable is so far as it goes in accordancewith the christian faith and nothing in revelation is contrary to reason but it is important toseparate the parts of the faith which can be proved by reason from those which cannot accordingly of the four books into which the summa is divided the first three make no appeal torevelation except to show that it is in accordance with conclusions reached by reason only in thefourth book are matters treated which cannot be known apart from revelation the first step is to prove the existence of god some think this unnecessary since the existence of god is selfevident if we knew gods essence this would be true since in god essence and existence are one but we do not know his essence except veryimperfectly wise men know more of his essence than do the ignorant and angels know more thaneither but no creature knows enough of it to be able to deduce gods existence from his essence on this ground the ontological argument is rejected it is important to remember that religious truth which can be proved can also be known by faith the proofs are difficult and can only be understood by the learned but faith is necessary also tothe ignorant to the young and to those who from practical preoccupations have not the leisure tolearn philosophy for them revelation suffices some say that god is only knowable by faith they argue that if the principles of demonstration became known to us through experience derived from thesenses as is said in the posterior analytics whatever transcends sense cannot be proved thishowever is false and even if it were true god could be known from his sensible effects the existence of god is proved as in aristotle by the argument of the unmoved mover there are things which are only moved and other things which both move and are moved whatever is moved is moved by something and since an endless regress is impossible wemust arrive somewhere at something which moves without being moved this unmoved moveris god it might be objected that this argument involves the eternity of movement which catholics reject this would be an error it is valid on the hypothesis of the eternity ofmovement but is only strengthened by the opposite hypothesis which involves a beginningand therefore a first cause in the summa theologiae five proofs of gods existence are given first the argument of theunmoved mover as above second the argument of the first cause which again depends uponthe impossibility of an infinite regress third that there must be an ultimate source of allnecessity this is much the same as the second argument fourth that we find variousperfections in the world and that these must have their source in something completely perfect fifth that we find even lifeless things serving a purpose which must be that of some beingoutside them since only living things can have an internal purpose to return to the summa contra gentiles having proved the existence of god we can now saymany things about him but these are all in a sense negative gods nature is only known to usthrough what it is not god is eternal since he is unmoved he is unchanging since hecontains no passive potentiality david of dinant raved that god is the same as primary matter this is absurd since primarymatter is pure passivity and god is pure activity in god there is no composition therefore heis not a body because bodies have parts god is his own essence since otherwise he would not be simple but would be compounded ofessence and existence this point is  but in aristotle the argument leads to or gods 
the principles of demonstration became known to us through experience derived from thesenses as is said in the posterior analytics whatever transcends sense cannot be proved thishowever is false and even if it were true god could be known from his sensible effects the existence of god is proved as in aristotle by the argument of the unmoved mover there are things which are only moved and other things which both move and are moved whatever is moved is moved by something and since an endless regress is impossible wemust arrive somewhere at something which moves without being moved this unmoved moveris god it might be objected that this argument involves the eternity of movement which catholics reject this would be an error it is valid on the hypothesis of the eternity ofmovement but is only strengthened by the opposite hypothesis which involves a beginningand therefore a first cause in the summa theologiae five proofs of gods existence are given first the argument of theunmoved mover as above second the argument of the first cause which again depends uponthe impossibility of an infinite regress third that there must be an ultimate source of allnecessity this is much the same as the second argument fourth that we find variousperfections in the world and that these must have their source in something completely perfect fifth that we find even lifeless things serving a purpose which must be that of some beingoutside them since only living things can have an internal purpose to return to the summa contra gentiles having proved the existence of god we can now saymany things about him but these are all in a sense negative gods nature is only known to usthrough what it is not god is eternal since he is unmoved he is unchanging since hecontains no passive potentiality david of dinant raved that god is the same as primary matter this is absurd since primarymatter is pure passivity and god is pure activity in god there is no composition therefore heis not a body because bodies have parts god is his own essence since otherwise he would not be simple but would be compounded ofessence and existence in god essence and existence are identical there are no accidents in god hecannot be specified by any substantial difference he is not in any genus he cannot be defined but he lacks not the excellence of any genus things are in some ways like god in others not it is more fitting to say that things are like god than that god is like things god is good and is his own goodness he is the good of every good he is intelligent and hisact of intelligence is his essence he understands by his essence and understands himselfperfectly although there is no composition in the divine intellect god understands many things thismight seem a difficulty but the things that he understands have no distinct being in him nordo they exist per se as plato thought because forms of natural things cannot exist or beunderstood apart from matter nevertheless god must understand forms before creating thesolution of this difficulty is as follows the concept of the divine intellect according as heunderstands himself which concept is his word is the likeness not only of god himselfunderstood but also of all the things of which the divine essence is the likeness accordinglymany things can be understood by god by one intelligible species which is the divine essenceand by one understood intention which is the divine word every form so far as it issomething positive is a perfection gods intellect includes in his essence what is proper toeach thing by understanding where it is like him and where unlike for instance life notknowledge is the essence of a plant and knowledge not intellect is the essence of an animal thus a plant is like god in being alive but unlike in not having knowledge an animal is like god in having knowledge but unlike in not having intellect it is always by a negation that acreature differs from god god understands all things at the same instant his knowledge is not a habit and is notdiscursive or argumentative god is truth we come now to a question which had already troubled both plato and aristotle can godknow particular things or does he only know universals and general truths a christian sincehe believes in provi  summa contra gentiles bk i ch liii dence must hold that god knows particular things nevertheless there are weighty argumentsagainst this view saint thomas enumerates seven such arguments and then proceeds to refutethem the seven arguments are as follows singularity being signate matter nothing immaterial can know it singulars do not always exist and cannot be known when they do not exist thereforethey cannot be known by an unchanging being singulars are contingent not necessary therefore there can be no certain knowledge ofthem except when they exist some singulars are due to volitions which can only be known to the person willing singulars are infinite in number and the infinite as such is unknown singulars are too petty for gods attention

cassius who are all three equally traitors the first against christ the other two against caesar dantes thought is interesting not only in itself but as that of a layman but it was not influentialand was hopelessly out of date marsiglio of padua on the contrary inaugurated the new form of opposition to the pope in which the emperor has mainly a role of decorative dignity he was a close friend of william of occam whose political opinions he influenced politically he is more important than occam he holds that the legislator is the majority of the people and that the majority has theright to punish princes he applies popular sovereignty also to the church and he includes thelaity there are to be local councils of the people including the laity who are to electrepresentatives to general councils the general council alone should have power toexcommunicate and to give authoritative interpretations of scripture thus all believers will havea voice in deciding doctrine the church is to have no secular authority there is to be noexcommunication without civil concurrence and the pope is to have no special powers occam did not go quite so far as marsiglio but he worked out a completely democratic method ofelecting the general council the conciliar movement came to a head in the early fifteenth century when it was needed to healthe great schism but having accomplished this task it subsided its standpoint as may be seenalready in marsiglio was different from that afterwards adopted in theory by the protestants the protestants claimed the right of private judgement and were not willing to submit to a general council they held that religious belief is not a matter to be decided by any governmentalmachinery marsiglio on the contrary still aims at preserving the unity of the catholic faith butwishes this to be done by democratic means not by the papal absolutism in practice most protestants when they acquired the government merely substituted the king for the pope andthus secured neither liberty of private judgement nor a democratic method of deciding doctrinalquestions but in their opposition to the pope they found support in the doctrines of the conciliarmovement of all the schoolmen occam was the one whom luther preferred it must be said thata considerable section of protestants held to the doctrine of private judgement even where the state was protestant this was the chief point of difference between independents and presbyterians in the english civil war occams political works are written in the style of philosophic disputations with argumentsfor and against various theses sometimes not reaching any conclusion we are accustomed to amore forthright kind of political propaganda but in his day the form he chose was probablyeffective a few samples will illustrate his method and outlook there is a long treatise called eight questions concerning the power of the pope the firstquestion is whether one man can rightfully be supreme both in church and state the second issecular authority derived immediately from god or not third has the pope the right to grantsecular jurisdiction to the emperor and other princes fourth does election by the electors givefull powers to the german king fifth and sixth what rights does the church acquire throughthe right of bishops to anoint kings seventh is a coronation ceremony valid if performed bythe wrong archbishop eighth does election by the electors give the german king the title of emperor all these were at the time burning questions of practical politics another treatise is on the question whether a prince can obtain the goods of the church withoutthe popes permission this is concerned to justify edward iii in taxing the clergy for his warwith france it will be remembered that edward was an ally of the emperor then comes a consultation on a matrimonial cause on the question whether the emperor wasjustified in marrying his cousin it will be seen that occam did his best to deserve the protection of the emperors sword it is time now to turn to occams purely philosophical doctrines on this subject there is a verygood book the logic of william of occam by ernest e moody much of what i shall have tosay is based on this book which takes a somewhat unusual view but i think a correct one there is a tendency in writers on history of philosophy to interpret men in the light of theirsuccessors but this is generally a mistake occam has been regarded as bringing about  see guilleimi de ockham opera politica manchester university press

chapter xv the eclipse of the papacy the thirteenth century had brought to completion a great synthesis philosophical theologicalpolitical and social which had been slowly built up by the combination of many elements thefirst element was pure greek philosophy especially the philosophies of pythagoras parmenides plato and aristotle then came as a result of alexanders conquests a great influxof oriental beliefs these taking advantage of orphism and the mysteries transformed theoutlook of the greekspeaking world and ultimately of the latinspeaking world also thedying and resurrected god the sacramental eating of what purported to be the flesh of the godthe second birth into a new life through some ceremony analogous to baptism came to be partof the theology of large sections of the pagan roman world with these was associated an ethicof liberation from bondage to the flesh which was at least theoretically ascetic from syria egypt babylonia and persia came the institution of a priesthood separated from the laypopulation possessed of more or less magical powers and able to exert considerable politicalinfluence impressive rituals largely connected with belief in a life after death came from thesame sources from persia in particular came a dualism which regarded the world as thebattleground of two great hosts one which was good led by ahura mazda the other whichwas evil led by ahriman black magic was the kind that was worked by the help of ahrimanand his followers in the world of spirits satan is a development of ahriman this influx of barbarian ideas and practices was synthesized with certain hellenic elements inthe neoplatonic philosophy in orphism pythagoreanism and some parts of plato the greekshad developed  see cumont oriental religions in roman paganism points of view which were easy to combine with those of the orient perhaps because they hadbeen borrowed from the east at a much earlier time with plotinus and porphyry the developmentof pagan philosophy ends the thought of these men however though deeply religious was not capable without muchtransformation of inspiring a victorious popular religion their philosophy was difficult andcould not be generally understood their way of salvation was too intellectual for the masses theirconservatism led them to uphold the traditional religion of greece which however they had tointerpret allegorically in order to soften its immoral elements and to reconcile it with theirphilosophical monotheism the greek religion had fallen into decay being unable to competewith eastern rituals and theologies the oracles had become silent and the priesthood had neverformed a powerful distinct caste the attempt to revive greek religion had therefore an archaisticcharacter which gave it a certain feebleness and pedantry especially noticeable in the emperor julian already in the third century it could have been foreseen that some asiatic religion wouldconquer the roman world though at that time there were still several competitors which allseemed to have a chance of victory christianity combined elements of strength from various sources from the jews it accepted a sacred book and the doctrine that all religions but one are false and evil but it avoided the racialexclusiveness of the jews and the inconveniences of the mosaic law later judaism had alreadylearnt to believe in the life after death but the christians gave a new definiteness to heaven andhell and to the ways of reaching the orte and escaping the other easter combined the jewish passover with pagan celebrations of the resurrected god persian dualism was absorbed but witha firmer assurance of the ultimate omnipotence of the good principle and with the addition thatthe pagan gods were followers of satan at first the christians were not the equals of theiradversaries in philosophy or in ritual but gradually these deficiencies were made good at firstphilosophy was more advanced among the semi christian gnostics than among the orthodox butfrom the time of origen onwards the christians developed an adequate philosophy bymodification of neoplatonism ritual among the early christians is a somewhat obscure subject 
points of view which were easy to combine with those of the orient perhaps because they hadbeen borrowed from the east at a much earlier time with plotinus and porphyry the developmentof pagan philosophy ends the thought of these men however though deeply religious was not capable without muchtransformation of inspiring a victorious popular religion their philosophy was difficult andcould not be generally understood their way of salvation was too intellectual for the masses theirconservatism led them to uphold the traditional religion of greece which however they had tointerpret allegorically in order to soften its immoral elements and to reconcile it with theirphilosophical monotheism the greek religion had fallen into decay being unable to competewith eastern rituals and theologies the oracles had become silent and the priesthood had neverformed a powerful distinct caste the attempt to revive greek religion had therefore an archaisticcharacter which gave it a certain feebleness and pedantry especially noticeable in the emperor julian already in the third century it could have been foreseen that some asiatic religion wouldconquer the roman world though at that time there were still several competitors which allseemed to have a chance of victory christianity combined elements of strength from various sources from the jews it accepted a sacred book and the doctrine that all religions but one are false and evil but it avoided the racialexclusiveness of the jews and the inconveniences of the mosaic law later judaism had alreadylearnt to believe in the life after death but the christians gave a new definiteness to heaven andhell and to the ways of reaching the orte and escaping the other easter combined the jewish passover with pagan celebrations of the resurrected god persian dualism was absorbed but witha firmer assurance of the ultimate omnipotence of the good principle and with the addition thatthe pagan gods were followers of satan at first the christians were not the equals of theiradversaries in philosophy or in ritual but gradually these deficiencies were made good at firstphilosophy was more advanced among the semi christian gnostics than among the orthodox butfrom the time of origen onwards the christians developed an adequate philosophy bymodification of neoplatonism ritual among the early christians is a somewhat obscure subject but at any rate by the time of saint ambrose it had become extremely impressive the power andthe separateness of the priesthood were taken from the east but were gradually strengthened bymethods of government in the church which owed much to the practice of the roman empire the old testament the mystery religions greek philosophy and roman methods ofadministration were all blended in the catholic church and combined to give it a strength whichno earlier social organization had equalled the western church like ancient rome developed though more slowly from a republic into amonarchy we have seen the stages in the growth of papal power from gregory the great through nicholas i gregory vii and innocent iii to the final defeat of the hohenstaufen in the wars of guelfs and ghibellines at the same time christian philosophy which had hitherto been augustinian and therefore largely platonic was enriched by new elements due to contact with constantinople and the mohammedans aristotle during the thirteenth century came to be knownfairly completely in the west and by the influence of albertus magnus and thomas aquinaswas established in the minds of the learned as the supreme authority after scripture and the church down to the present day he has retained this position among catholic philosophers icannot but think that the substitution of aristotle for plato and saint augustine was a mistakefrom the christian point of view platos temperament was more religious than aristotles and christian theology had been from almost the first adapted to platonism plato had taught thatknowledge is not perception but a kind of reminiscent vision aristotle was much more of anempiricist saint thomas little though he intended it prepared the way for the return from platonic dreaming to scientific observation outward events had more to do than philosophy with the disintegration of the catholic synthesiswhich began in the fourteenth century the byzantine empire was conquered by the latins in and remained in their hands till during this time the religion of its government was catholic not greek but after constantinople was lost to the pope and never recovered inspite of nominal union at ferrara in the defeat of the western empire in its conflict withthe papacy proved useless to the church owing to the rise of national monarchies in france and england throughout most 
but at any rate by the time of saint ambrose it had become extremely impressive the power andthe separateness of the priesthood were taken from the east but were gradually strengthened bymethods of government in the church which owed much to the practice of the roman empire the old testament the mystery religions greek philosophy and roman methods ofadministration were all blended in the catholic church and combined to give it a strength whichno earlier social organization had equalled the western church like ancient rome developed though more slowly from a republic into amonarchy we have seen the stages in the growth of papal power from gregory the great through nicholas i gregory vii and innocent iii to the final defeat of the hohenstaufen in the wars of guelfs and ghibellines at the same time christian philosophy which had hitherto been augustinian and therefore largely platonic was enriched by new elements due to contact with constantinople and the mohammedans aristotle during the thirteenth century came to be knownfairly completely in the west and by the influence of albertus magnus and thomas aquinaswas established in the minds of the learned as the supreme authority after scripture and the church down to the present day he has retained this position among catholic philosophers icannot but think that the substitution of aristotle for plato and saint augustine was a mistakefrom the christian point of view platos temperament was more religious than aristotles and christian theology had been from almost the first adapted to platonism plato had taught thatknowledge is not perception but a kind of reminiscent vision aristotle was much more of anempiricist saint thomas little though he intended it prepared the way for the return from platonic dreaming to scientific observation outward events had more to do than philosophy with the disintegration of the catholic synthesiswhich began in the fourteenth century the byzantine empire was conquered by the latins in and remained in their hands till during this time the religion of its government was catholic not greek but after constantinople was lost to the pope and never recovered inspite of nominal union at ferrara in the defeat of the western empire in its conflict withthe papacy proved useless to the church owing to the rise of national monarchies in france and england throughout most of the fourteenth century the pope was politically a tool in the hands of the king of france moreimportant than these causes was the rise of a rich commercial class and the increase of knowledgein the laity both of these began in italy and remained more advanced in that country than in otherparts of the west until the middle of the sixteenth century north italian cities were much richerin the fourteenth century than any of the cities of the north and learned laymen especially in lawand medicine were becoming increasingly numerous the cities had a spirit of independencewhich now that the emperor was no longer a menace was apt to turn against the pope but thesame movements though to a lesser degree existed elsewhere flanders prospered so did the hanse towns in england the wool trade was a source of wealth the age was one in whichtendencies which may be broadly called democratic were very strong and nationalistic tendencieswere even stronger the papacy which had become very worldly appeared largely as a taxingagency drawing to itself vast revenues which most countries wished to retain at home the popesno longer had or deserved the moral authority which had given them power saint francis hadbeen able to work in harmony with innocent iii and gregory ix but the most earnest men of thefourteenth century were driven into conflict with the papacy at the beginning of the century however these causes of decline in the papacy were not yetapparent boniface viii in the bull unam sanctam made more extreme claims than had everbeen made by any previous pope he instituted in the year of jubilee when plenaryindulgence is granted to all catholics who visit rome and perform certain ceremonies while there this brought immense sums of money to the coffers of the curia and the pockets of the romanpeople there was to be a jubilee every hundredth year but the profits were so great that theperiod was shortened to fifty years and then to twentyfive at which it remains to the present day the first jubilee that of showed the pope at the summit of his success and may beconveniently regarded as the date from which the decline began boniface viii was an italian born at anagni he had been besieged in the tower of london whenin england on behalf of the pope to support henry iii against the rebellious barons but he was 
of the fourteenth century the pope was politically a tool in the hands of the king of france moreimportant than these causes was the rise of a rich commercial class and the increase of knowledgein the laity both of these began in italy and remained more advanced in that country than in otherparts of the west until the middle of the sixteenth century north italian cities were much richerin the fourteenth century than any of the cities of the north and learned laymen especially in lawand medicine were becoming increasingly numerous the cities had a spirit of independencewhich now that the emperor was no longer a menace was apt to turn against the pope but thesame movements though to a lesser degree existed elsewhere flanders prospered so did the hanse towns in england the wool trade was a source of wealth the age was one in whichtendencies which may be broadly called democratic were very strong and nationalistic tendencieswere even stronger the papacy which had become very worldly appeared largely as a taxingagency drawing to itself vast revenues which most countries wished to retain at home the popesno longer had or deserved the moral authority which had given them power saint francis hadbeen able to work in harmony with innocent iii and gregory ix but the most earnest men of thefourteenth century were driven into conflict with the papacy at the beginning of the century however these causes of decline in the papacy were not yetapparent boniface viii in the bull unam sanctam made more extreme claims than had everbeen made by any previous pope he instituted in the year of jubilee when plenaryindulgence is granted to all catholics who visit rome and perform certain ceremonies while there this brought immense sums of money to the coffers of the curia and the pockets of the romanpeople there was to be a jubilee every hundredth year but the profits were so great that theperiod was shortened to fifty years and then to twentyfive at which it remains to the present day the first jubilee that of showed the pope at the summit of his success and may beconveniently regarded as the date from which the decline began boniface viii was an italian born at anagni he had been besieged in the tower of london whenin england on behalf of the pope to support henry iii against the rebellious barons but he was rescued in by the kings son afterwards edward i there was already in his day a powerful french party in the church and his election was opposed by the french cardinals he came intoviolent conflict with the french king philip iv on the question whether the king had the right totax the french clergy boniface was addicted to nepotism and avarice he therefore wished toretain control over as many sources of revenue as possible he was accused of heresy probablywith justice it seems that he was an averroist and did not believe in immortality his quarrel withthe king of france became so bitter that the king sent a force to arrest him with a view to hisbeing deposed by a general council he was caught at anagni but escaped to rome where hedied after this for a long time no pope ventured to oppose the king of france after a very brief intermediate reign the cardinals in elected the archbishop of bordeauxwho took the name of clement v he was a gascon and consistently represented the french partyin the church throughout his pontificate he never went to italy he was crowned in lyons and in he settled in avignon where the popes remained for about seventy years clement vsignalized his alliance with the king of france by their joint action against the templars bothneeded money the pope because he was addicted to favouritism and nepotism philip for the english war the flemish revolt and the costs of an increasingly energetic government after hehad plundered the bankers of lombardy and persecuted the jews to the limit of what the trafficwould bear it occurred to him that the templars in addition to being bankers had immenselanded estates in france which with the popes help he might acquire it was therefore arrangedthat the church should discover that the templars had fallen into heresy and that king and popeshould share the spoils on a given day in all the leading templars in france were arresteda list of leading questions previously drawn up was put to them all under torture they confessedthat they had done homage to satan and committed various other abominations at last in the pope suppressed the order and all its property was confiscated the best account of thisproceeding is in henry c leas history of the inquisition where after full investigation theconclusion is reached that the charges against the templars were wholly without foundation

in the case of the templars the financial interests of pope and king coincided but on mostoccasions in most parts of christendom they conflicted in the time of boniface viii philip ivhad secured the support of the estates in his disputes with the pope as to taxation when the popes became politically subservient to france the sovereignshostile to the french king were necessarily hostile to the pope this led to the protection of william of occam and marsiglio of padua by the emperor at a slightly later date it led to theprotection of wycliffe by john of gaunt bishops in general were by this time completely in subjection to the pope in an increasingproportion they were actually appointed by him the monastic orders and the dominicans wereequally obedient but the franciscans still had a certain spirit of independence this led to theirconflict with john xxii which we have already considered in connection with william of occam during this conflict marsiglio persuaded the emperor to march on romewhere the imperial crown was conferred on him by the populace and a franciscan antipope waselected after the populace had declared john xxii deposed however nothing came of all thisbeyond a general diminution of respect for the papacy the revolt against papal domination took different forms in different places sometimes it wasassociated with monarchical nationalism sometimes with a puritan horror of the corruption andworldliness of the papal court in rome itself the revolt was associated with an archaisticdemocracy under clement vi rome for a time sought to free itself from the absenteepope under the leadership of a remarkable man cola di rienzi rome suffered not only from therule of the popes but also from the local aristocracy which continued the turbulence that haddegraded the papacy in the tenth century indeed it was partly to escape from the lawless romannobles that the popes had fled to avignon at first rienzi who was the son of a tavernkeeperrebelled only against the nobles and in this he had the support of the pope he roused so muchpopular enthusiasm that the nobles fled petrarch who admired him and wrote an ode tohim urged him to continue his great and noble work he took the title of tribune and proclaimedthe sovereignty of the roman people over the empire he seems to have conceived this sovereignty democratically for he called representatives from the italian cities to asort of parliament success however gave him delusions of grandeur at this time as at manyothers there were rival claimants to the empire rienzi summoned both of them and the electorsto come before him to have the issue decided this naturally turned both imperial candidatesagainst him and also the pope who considered that it was for him to pronounce judgement insuch matters rienzi was captured by the pope and kept in prison for two years until clement vi died then he was released and returned to rome where he acquired power again fora few months on this second occasion however his popularity was brief and in the end he wasmurdered by the mob byron as well as petrarch wrote a poem in his praise it became evident that if the papacy was to remain effectively the head of the whole catholic church it must free itself from dependence on france by returning to rome moreover the anglo french war in which france was suffering severe defeats made france unsafe urban vtherefore went to rome in but italian politics were too complicated for him and he returnedto avignon shortly before his death the next pope gregory xi was more resolute hostility tothe french curia had made many italian towns especially florence bitterly antipapal but byreturning to rome and opposing the french cardinals gregory did everything in his power to savethe situation however at his death the french and roman parties in the college of cardinalsproved irreconcilable in accordance with the wishes of the roman party an italian bartolomeo prignano was elected and took the name of urban vi but a number of cardinals declared hiselection uncanonical and proceeded to elect robert of geneva who belonged to the french party he took the name of clement vii and lived in avignon thus began the great schism which lasted for some forty years france of course recognized the avignon pope and the enemies of france recognized the roman pope scotland was the enemyof england and england of france therefore scotland recognized the avignon pope each popechose cardinals from among his own partisans and when either died his cardinals quickly electedanother thus there was no way of healing the schism except by bringing to bear some powersuperior to both popes it was clear that one of them 
conceived this sovereignty democratically for he called representatives from the italian cities to asort of parliament success however gave him delusions of grandeur at this time as at manyothers there were rival claimants to the empire rienzi summoned both of them and the electorsto come before him to have the issue decided this naturally turned both imperial candidatesagainst him and also the pope who considered that it was for him to pronounce judgement insuch matters rienzi was captured by the pope and kept in prison for two years until clement vi died then he was released and returned to rome where he acquired power again fora few months on this second occasion however his popularity was brief and in the end he wasmurdered by the mob byron as well as petrarch wrote a poem in his praise it became evident that if the papacy was to remain effectively the head of the whole catholic church it must free itself from dependence on france by returning to rome moreover the anglo french war in which france was suffering severe defeats made france unsafe urban vtherefore went to rome in but italian politics were too complicated for him and he returnedto avignon shortly before his death the next pope gregory xi was more resolute hostility tothe french curia had made many italian towns especially florence bitterly antipapal but byreturning to rome and opposing the french cardinals gregory did everything in his power to savethe situation however at his death the french and roman parties in the college of cardinalsproved irreconcilable in accordance with the wishes of the roman party an italian bartolomeo prignano was elected and took the name of urban vi but a number of cardinals declared hiselection uncanonical and proceeded to elect robert of geneva who belonged to the french party he took the name of clement vii and lived in avignon thus began the great schism which lasted for some forty years france of course recognized the avignon pope and the enemies of france recognized the roman pope scotland was the enemyof england and england of france therefore scotland recognized the avignon pope each popechose cardinals from among his own partisans and when either died his cardinals quickly electedanother thus there was no way of healing the schism except by bringing to bear some powersuperior to both popes it was clear that one of them must be legitimate therefore a power superior to a legitimate pope had to be found the onlysolution lay in a general council the university of paris led by gerson developed a new theorygiving powers of initiative to a council the lay sovereigns to whom the schism wasinconvenient lent their support at last in a council was summoned and met at pisa itfailed however in a ridiculous manner it declared both popes deposed for heresy and schism andelected a third who promptly died but his cardinals elected as his successor an expirate named baldassare cossa who took the name of john xxiii thus the net result was that there were threepopes instead of two the conciliar pope being a notorious ruffian at this stage the situationseemed more hopeless than ever but the supporters of the conciliar movement did not give in in a new council wassummoned at constance and proceeded to vigorous action it first decreed that popes cannotdissolve councils and must submit to them in certain respects it also decided that future popesmust summon a general council every seven years it deposed john xxiii and induced the roman pope to resign the avignon pope refused to resign and after his death the king of aragon caused a successor to be elected but france at this time at the mercy of england refusedto recognize him and his party dwindled into insignificance and finally ceased to exist thus atlast there was no opposition to the pope chosen by the council who was elected in and tookthe name of martin v these proceedings were creditable but the treatment of huss the bohemian disciple of wycliffewas not he was brought to constance with the promise of a safe conduct but when he got therehe was condemned and suffered death at the stake wycliffe was safely dead but the councilordered his bones dug up and burnt the supporters of the conciliar movement were anxious tofree themselves from all suspicion of unorthodoxy the council of constance had healed the schism but it had hoped to do much more and tosubstitute a constitutional monarchy for the papal absolutism martin v had made many promisesbefore his election some he kept some he broke he had assented to the decree that a councilshould be summoned every seven years and to this decree he remained obedient the council of constance having been dissolved in a new council which proved of no importance

chapter iv heraclitus two opposite attitudes towards the greeks are common at the present day one which waspractically universal from the renaissance until very recent times views the greeks with almostsuperstitious reverence as the inventors of all that is best and as men of superhuman geniuswhom the moderns cannot hope to equal the other attitude inspired by the triumphs of scienceand by an optimistic belief in progress considers the authority of the ancients an incubus andmaintains that most of their contributions to thought are now best forgotten i cannot myself takeeither of these extreme views each i should say is partly right and partly wrong before enteringupon any detail i shall try to say what sort of wisdom we can still derive from the study of greekthought as to the nature and structure of the world various hypotheses are possible progress inmetaphysics so far as it has existed has consisted in a gradual refinement of all these hypothesesa development of their implications and a reformulation of each to meet the objections urged byadherents of rival hypotheses to learn to conceive the universe according to each of thesesystems is an imaginative delight and an antidote to dogmatism moreover even if no one of thehypotheses can be demonstrated there is genuine knowledge in the discovery of what is involvedin making each of them consistent with itself and with known facts now almost all thehypotheses that have dominated modern philosophy were first thought of by the greeks theirimaginative inventiveness in abstract matters can hardly be too highly praised what i shall haveto say about the greeks will be said mainly from this point of view i shall regard them as givingbirth to theories which have had an independent life and growth and which though at firstsomewhat infantile have proved capable of surviving and developing throughout more than twothousand years the greeks contributed it is true something else which proved of more permanent value toabstract thought they discovered mathematics and the art of deductive reasoning geometry inparticular is a greek invention without which modern science would have been impossible butin connection with mathematics the onesidedness of the greek genius appears it reasoneddeductively from what appeared selfevident not inductively from what had been observed itsamazing successes in the employment of this method misled not only the ancient world but thegreater part of the modern world also it has only been very slowly that scientific method whichseeks to reach principles inductively from observation of particular facts has replaced the hellenic belief in deduction from luminous axioms derived from the mind of the philosopher forthis reason apart from others it is a mistake to treat the greeks with superstitious reverence scientific method though some few among them were the first men who had an inkling of it ison the whole alien to their temper of mind and the attempt to glorify them by belittling theintellectual progress of the last four centuries has a cramping effect upon modern thought there is however a more general argument against reverence whether for the greeks or foranyone else in studying a philosopher the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt butfirst a kind of hypothetical sympathy until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in histheories and only then a revival of the critical attitude which should resemble as far as possiblethe state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held contempt interfereswith the first part of this process and reverence with the second two things are to beremembered that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be presumed to havehad some intelligence but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete and final truth on anysubject whatever when an intelligent man expresses a view which seems to us obviously absurdwe should not attempt to prove that it is somehow true but we should try to understand how itever came to seem true this exercise of historical and psychological imagination at once enlargesthe scope of our thinking and helps us to realize how foolish many of our own cherishedprejudices will seem to an age which has a different temper of mind between pythagoras and heraclitus with whom we shall be con

wycliffes departure from orthodoxy began in with a course of lectures at oxford on civil dominion he advanced the theory that righteousness alone gives the title to dominion andproperty that unrighteous clergy have no such title and that the decision as to whether anecclesiastic should retain his property or not ought to be taken by the civil power he taughtfurther that property is the result of sin christ and the apostles had no property and the clergyought to have none these doctrines offended all clerics except the friars the englishgovernment however favoured them for the pope drew a huge tribute from england and thedoctrine that money should not be sent out of england to the pope was a convenient one this wasespecially the case while the pope was subservient to france and england was at war with france john of gaunt who held power during the minority of richard ii befriended wycliffe aslong as possible gregory xi on the other hand condemned eighteen theses in wycliffes lecturessaying that they were derived from marsiglio of padua wycliffe was summoned to appear fortrial before a tribunal of bishops but the queen and the mob protected him while the university of oxford refused to admit the popes jurisdiction over its teachers meanwhile wycliffe continued during and to write learned treatises maintaining thatthe king is gods vicar and that bishops are subject to him when the great schism came he wentfurther than before branding the pope as antichrist and saying that acceptance of the donation of constantine had made all subsequent popes apostates he translated the vulgate into english andestablished poor priests who were secular heemployed the poor priests as itinerant preachers whose mission was especially to the poor atlast in attacking sacerdotal power he was led to deny transubstantiation which he called a deceitand a blasphemous folly at this point john of gaunt ordered him to be silent the peasants revolt of led by wat tyler made matters more difficult for wycliffe thereis no evidence that he actively encouraged it but unlike luther in similar circumstances herefrained from condemning it john ball the socialist unfrocked priest who was one of theleaders admired wycliffe which was embarrassing but as he had been excommunicated in when wycliffe was still orthodox he must havearrived independently at his opinions wycliffes communistic opinions though no doubt thepoor priests disseminated them were by him only stated in latin so that at first hand they wereinaccessible to peasants it is surprising that wycliffe did not suffer more than he did for his opinions and his democraticactivities the university of oxford defended him against the bishops as long as possible whenthe house of lords condemned his itinerant preachers the house of commons refused to concur no doubt trouble would have accumulated if he had lived longer but when he died in he hadnot yet been formally condemned he was buried at lutterworth where he died and his boneswere left in peace until the council of constance had them dug up and burnt his followers in england the lollards were severely persecuted and practically stamped out butowing to the fact that richard iis wife was a bohemian his doctrines became known in bohemiawhere huss was his disciple and in bohemia in spite of persecution they survived until the

a powerful centralized state nothing was attributable to roman philosophy since there wasnone during this long period the greek ideas inherited from the age of freedom underwent a gradualprocess of transformation some of the old ideas notably those which we should regard asspecifically religious gained in relative importance others more rationalistic were discardedbecause they no longer suited the spirit of the age in this way the later pagans trimmed the greek tradition until it became suitable for incorporation in christian doctrine christianity popularized an important opinion already implicit in the teaching of the stoics butforeign to the general spirit of antiquity i mean the opinion that a mans duty to god is moreimperative than his duty to the state this opinionthat we ought to obey god rather than man as socrates and the apostles saidsurvived the conversion of constantine because theearly christian emperors were arians or inclined to arianism when the emperors becameorthodox it fell into abeyance in the byzantine empire it remained latent as also in thesubsequent russian empire which derived its christianity from constantinople but in the west where the catholic emperors were almost immediately replaced by heretical barbarian conquerors the superiority of religious to political allegiance survivedand to some extent still survives the barbarian invasion put an end for six centuries to the civilization of western europe itlingered in ireland until the danes destroyed it in the ninth century before its extinction there itproduced one notable figure scotus erigena in the eastern empire greek civilization in adesiccated form survived as in a museum till the fall of constantinople in but nothingof importance to the world came out of constantinople except an artistic tradition and justinians codes of roman law during the period of darkness from the end of the fifth century to the middle of the elevenththe western roman world underwent some very interesting changes the conflict between dutyto god and duty to the state which christianity had introduced took the form of a conflictbetween church and king the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the pope extended over italy france and spain great  that is why the modern russian does not think that we ought to obey dialecticalmaterialism rather than stalin britain and ireland germany scandinavia and poland at first outside italy and southern francehis control over bishops and abbots was very slight but from the time of gregory vii it became real and effective from that time on the clergy throughout western europe formed a single organization directed from rome seeking power intelligently andrelentlessly and usually victorious until after the year in their conflicts with secular rulers the conflict between church and state was not only a conflict between clergy and laity it wasalso a renewal of the conflict between the mediterranean world and the northern barbarians theunity of the church echoed the unity of the roman empire its liturgy was latin and its dominantmen were mostly italian spanish or southern french their education when education revivedwas classical their conceptions of law and government would have been more intelligible to marcus aurelius than they were to contemporary monarchs the church represented at oncecontinuity with the past and what was most civilized in the present the secular power on the contrary was in the hands of kings and barons of teutonic descentwho endeavoured to preserve what they could of the institutions that they had brought out of theforests of germany absolute power was alien to those institutions and so was what appeared tothese vigorous conquerors as a dull and spiritless legality the king had to share his power withthe feudal aristocracy but all alike expected to be allowed occasional outbursts of passion in theform of war murder pillage or rape monarchs might repent for they were sincerely pious andafter all repentance was itself a form of passion but the church could never produce in them thequiet regularity of good behaviour which a modern employer demands and usually obtains of hisemployees what was the use of conquering the world if they could not drink and murder and loveas the spirit moved them and why should they with their armies of proud knights submit to theorders of bookish men vowed to celibacy and destitute of armed force in spite of ecclesiasticaldisapproval they preserved the duel and trial by battle and they developed tournaments andcourtly love occasionally in a fit of rage they would even murder eminent churchmen all the armed force was on the side of the kings and yet the church was victorious the churchwon partly because it had almost a 
cerned in this chapter there was another philosopher of less importance namely xenophanes his date is uncertain and is mainly determined by the fact that he alludes to pythagoras and heraclitus alludes to him he was an ionian by birth but lived most of his life in southern italy he believed all things to be made out of earth and water as regards the gods he was a veryemphatic free thinker homer and hesiod have ascribed to the gods all things that are a shameand a disgrace among mortals stealings and adulteries and deceivings of one another  mortals deem that gods are begotten as they are and have clothes like theirs and voice andform  yes and if oxen and horses or lions had hands and could paint with their hands andproduce works of art as men do horses would paint the forms of gods like horses and oxen likeoxen and make their bodies in the image of their several kinds  the ethiopians make theirgods black and snubnosed the thracians say theirs have blue eyes and red hair he believedin one god unlike men in form and thought who without toil swayeth all things by the forceof his mind xenophanes made fun of the pythagorean doctrine of transmigration once theysay he was passing by when a dog was being illtreated stop he said dont hitit it is the soul of a friend i knew it when i heard its voice he believed it impossible toascertain the truth in matters of theology the certain truth there is no man who knows norever shall be about the gods and all the things whereof i speak yea even if a man shouldchance to say something utterly right still he himself knows it notthere is nowhere anythingbut guessing xenophanes has his place in the succession of rationalists who were opposed to the mysticaltendencies of pythagoras and others but as an independent thinker he is not in the first rank the doctrine of pythagoras as we saw is very difficult to disentangle from that of his disciplesand although pythagoras himself is very early the influence of his school is mainly subsequentto that of various other philosophers the first of these to invent a theory which is stillinfluential was heraclitus who flourished about bc of his life very little is knownexcept that he was an aristocratic citizen of ephesus he was chiefly famous in antiquity for hisdoctrine  quoted from edwyn bevan stoics and sceptics oxford p  that everything is in a state of flux but this as we shall see is only one aspect of hismetaphysics heraclitus though an ionian was not in the scientific tradition of the milesians he was amystic but of a peculiar kind he regarded fire as the fundamental substance everything likeflame in a fire is born by the death of something else mortals are immortals and immortalsare mortals the one living the others death and dying the others life there is unity in theworld but it is a unity formed by the combination of opposites all things come out of the oneand the one out of all things but the many have less reality than the one which is god from what survives of his writings he does not appear as an amiable character he was muchaddicted to contempt and was the reverse of a democrat concerning his fellowcitizens hesays the ephesians would do well to hang themselves every grown man of them and leavethe city to beardless lads for they have cast out hermodorus the best man among them sayingwe will have none who is best among us if there be any such let him be so elsewhere andamong others he speaks ill of all his eminent predecessors with a single exception homershould be turned out of the lists and whipped of all whose discourses i have heard there isnot one who attains to understanding that wisdom is apart from all the learning of manythings teacheth not understanding else would it have taught hesiod and pythagoras and again xenophanes and hecataeus pythagoras  claimed for his own wisdom what was but aknowledge of many things and an art of mischief the one exception to his condemnations is teutamus who is signalled out as of more account than the rest when we inquire the reasonfor this praise we find that teutamus said most men are bad his contempt for mankind leads him to think that only force will compel them to act for theirown good he says every beast is driven to the pasture with blows and again asses wouldrather have straw than gold as might be expected heraclitus believes in war war he says is the father of all and theking of all and some he has made gods and some men some bond and some free againhomer was  cornford op cit emphasises this i think rightly heraclitus is oftenmisunderstood through being assimilated to other ionians 
a chapter entitled in what way princes must keep faith we learn that they shouldkeep faith when it pays to do so but not otherwise a prince must on occasion be faithless but it is necessary to be able to disguise this character well and to be a great feigner anddissembler and men are so simple and so ready to obey present necessities that one who deceiveswill always find those who allow themselves to be deceived i will mention only one moderninstance alexander vi did nothing else but deceive men he thought of nothing else and foundthe occasion for it no man was ever more able to give assurances or affirmed things with strongeroaths and no man observed them less however he always succeeded in his deceptions as heknew well this aspect of things it is not necessary therefore for a prince to have all the abovenamed qualities the conventional virtues but it is very necessary to seem to have them he goes on to say that above all a prince should seem to be religious the tone of the discourses which are nominally a commentary on livy is very different thereare whole chapters which seem almost as if they had been written by montesquieu most of thebook could have been read with approval by an eighteenthcentury liberal the doctrine of checksand balances is set forth explicitly princes nobles and people should all have a part in the constitution then these three powers will keep each other reciprocally in check theconstitution of sparta as established by lycurgus was the best because it embodied the mostperfect balance that of solon was too democratic and therefore led to the tyranny of peisistratus the roman republican constitution was good owing to the conflict of senate and people the word liberty is used throughout as denoting something precious though what it denotes isnot very clear this of course comes from antiquity and was passed on to the eighteenth andnineteenth centuries tuscany has preserved its liberties because it contains no castles orgentlemen it seems to berecognized that political liberty requires a certain kind of personal virtue in the citizens in germany alone we are told probity and religion are still common and therefore in germany thereare many republics in general the people are wiser and more constant than princes although livy and most other writers maintain the opposite it is not without good reason that it is said the voice ofthe people is the voice of god it is interesting to observe how the political thought of the greeks and romans in their republicandays acquired an actuality in the fifteenth century which it had not had in greece since alexanderor in rome since augustus the neoplatonists the arabs and the schoolmen took a passionateinterest in the metaphysics of plato and aristotle but none at all in their political writingsbecause the political systems of the age of city states had completely disappeared the growth of city states in italy synchronized with the revival of learning and made it possible for humaniststo profit by the political theories of republican greeks and romans the love of liberty and thetheory of checks and balances came to the renaissance from antiquity and to modern timeslargely from the renaissance though also directly from antiquity this aspect of machiavelli is atleast as important as the more famous immoral doctrines of the prince it is to be noted that machiavelli never bases any political argument on christian or biblicalgrounds medieval writers had a conception of legitimate power which was that of the pope andthe emperor or derived from them northern writers even so late as locke argue as to whathappened in the garden of eden and think that they can thence derive proofs that certain kinds ofpower are legitimate in machiavelli there is no such conception power is for those who havethe skill to seize it in a free competition his preference for popular government is not derivedfrom any idea of rights but from the observation that popular governments are less cruelunscrupulous and inconstant than tyrannies let us try to make a synthesis of the moral andimmoral parts of his doctrine in what follows i am expressing not my own opinions butopinions which are explicitly or implicitly his there are certain political goods of which three are specially important national independencesecurity and a wellordered constitution the best constitution is one which apportions legalrights among prince nobles and people in proportion to their real power for under such aconstitution successful revolutions are difficult and therefore stability is possible but forconsiderations of stability it would be wise to give more power to the people so far as regardsends 
most other writers maintain the opposite it is not without good reason that it is said the voice ofthe people is the voice of god it is interesting to observe how the political thought of the greeks and romans in their republicandays acquired an actuality in the fifteenth century which it had not had in greece since alexanderor in rome since augustus the neoplatonists the arabs and the schoolmen took a passionateinterest in the metaphysics of plato and aristotle but none at all in their political writingsbecause the political systems of the age of city states had completely disappeared the growth of city states in italy synchronized with the revival of learning and made it possible for humaniststo profit by the political theories of republican greeks and romans the love of liberty and thetheory of checks and balances came to the renaissance from antiquity and to modern timeslargely from the renaissance though also directly from antiquity this aspect of machiavelli is atleast as important as the more famous immoral doctrines of the prince it is to be noted that machiavelli never bases any political argument on christian or biblicalgrounds medieval writers had a conception of legitimate power which was that of the pope andthe emperor or derived from them northern writers even so late as locke argue as to whathappened in the garden of eden and think that they can thence derive proofs that certain kinds ofpower are legitimate in machiavelli there is no such conception power is for those who havethe skill to seize it in a free competition his preference for popular government is not derivedfrom any idea of rights but from the observation that popular governments are less cruelunscrupulous and inconstant than tyrannies let us try to make a synthesis of the moral andimmoral parts of his doctrine in what follows i am expressing not my own opinions butopinions which are explicitly or implicitly his there are certain political goods of which three are specially important national independencesecurity and a wellordered constitution the best constitution is one which apportions legalrights among prince nobles and people in proportion to their real power for under such aconstitution successful revolutions are difficult and therefore stability is possible but forconsiderations of stability it would be wise to give more power to the people so far as regardsends but there is also in politics the question of means it is futile to pursue a political purpose bymethods that are bound to fail if the end is held good we must choose means adequate to itsachievement the question of means can be treated in a purely scientific manner without regard tothe goodness or badness of the ends success means the achievement of your purpose whateverit may be if there is a science of success it can be studied just as well in the successes of thewicked as in those of the goodindeed better since the examples of successful sinners are morenumerous than those of successful saints but the science once established will be just as usefulto the saint as to the sinner for the saint if he concerns himself with politics must wish just asthe sinner does to achieve success the question is ultimately one of power to achieve a political end power of one kind or anotheris necessary this plain fact is concealed by slogans such as right will prevail or the triumph ofevil is shortlived if the side that you think right prevails that is because it has superior power itis true that power often depends upon opinion and opinion upon propaganda it is true also thatit is an advantage in propaganda to seem more virtuous than your adversary and that one way ofseeming virtuous is to be virtuous for this reason it may sometimes happen that victory goes tothe side which has the most of what the general public considers to be virtue we must concede to machiavelli that this was an important element in the growing power of the church during theeleventh twelfth and thirteenth centuries as well as in the success of the reformation in thesixteenth century but there are important limitations in the first place those who have seizedpower can by controlling propaganda cause their party to appear virtuous no one for examplecould mention the sins of alexander vi in a new york or boston public school in the secondplace there are chaotic periods during which obvious knavery frequently succeeds the period of machiavelli was one of them in such times there tends to be a rapidly growing cynicism whichmakes men forgive anything provided it pays even in such times as machiavelli himself says itis desirable to present an appearance of virtue before the ignorant public this question can be carried a step further machiavelli is of opinion that civilized men are almostcertain to be unscrupulous egoists if a man wished nowadays to establish a republic he says hewould find 
but there is also in politics the question of means it is futile to pursue a political purpose bymethods that are bound to fail if the end is held good we must choose means adequate to itsachievement the question of means can be treated in a purely scientific manner without regard tothe goodness or badness of the ends success means the achievement of your purpose whateverit may be if there is a science of success it can be studied just as well in the successes of thewicked as in those of the goodindeed better since the examples of successful sinners are morenumerous than those of successful saints but the science once established will be just as usefulto the saint as to the sinner for the saint if he concerns himself with politics must wish just asthe sinner does to achieve success the question is ultimately one of power to achieve a political end power of one kind or anotheris necessary this plain fact is concealed by slogans such as right will prevail or the triumph ofevil is shortlived if the side that you think right prevails that is because it has superior power itis true that power often depends upon opinion and opinion upon propaganda it is true also thatit is an advantage in propaganda to seem more virtuous than your adversary and that one way ofseeming virtuous is to be virtuous for this reason it may sometimes happen that victory goes tothe side which has the most of what the general public considers to be virtue we must concede to machiavelli that this was an important element in the growing power of the church during theeleventh twelfth and thirteenth centuries as well as in the success of the reformation in thesixteenth century but there are important limitations in the first place those who have seizedpower can by controlling propaganda cause their party to appear virtuous no one for examplecould mention the sins of alexander vi in a new york or boston public school in the secondplace there are chaotic periods during which obvious knavery frequently succeeds the period of machiavelli was one of them in such times there tends to be a rapidly growing cynicism whichmakes men forgive anything provided it pays even in such times as machiavelli himself says itis desirable to present an appearance of virtue before the ignorant public this question can be carried a step further machiavelli is of opinion that civilized men are almostcertain to be unscrupulous egoists if a man wished nowadays to establish a republic he says hewould find it easier with mountaineers than with the men of a large city since the latter would be alreadycorrupted if a man is an unscrupulous egoist his wisest line of conduct will depend upon thepopulation with which he has to operate the renaissance church shocked everybody but itwas only north of the alps that it shocked people enough to produce the reformation at thetime when luther began his revolt the revenue of the papacy was probably larger than it wouldhave been if alexander vi and julius ii had been more virtuous and if this is true it is sobecause of the cynicism of renaissance italy it follows that politicians will behave better whenthey depend upon a virtuous population than when they depend upon one which is indifferent tomoral considerations they will also behave better in a community in which their crimes if anycan be made widely known than in one in which there is a strict censorship under their control a certain amount can of course always be achieved by hypocrisy but the amount can be muchdiminished by suitable institutions machiavellis political thinking like that of most of the ancients is in one respect somewhatshallow he is occupied with great law givers such as lycurgus and solon who are supposedto create a community all in one piece with little regard to what has gone before theconception of a community as an organic growth which the statesmen can only affect to alimited extent is in the main modern and has been greatly strengthened by the theory ofevolution this conception is not to be found in machiavelli any more than in plato it might however be maintained that the evolutionary view of society though true in the pastis no longer applicable but must for the present and the future be replaced by a much moremechanistic view in russia and germany new societies have been created in much the sameway as the mythical lycurgus was supposed to have created the spartan polity the ancient lawgiver was a benevolent myth the modern law giver is a terrifying reality the world has becomemore like that of machiavelli than it was and the modern man who hopes to refute hisphilosophy must think more deeply than seemed necessary in the nineteenth century  it is curious to find this anticipation of rousseau it would be amusing and not whollyfalse to interpret machiavelli as a disappointed romantic

chapter iv erasmus and more in northern countries the renaissance began later than in italy and soon became entangled withthe reformation but there was a brief period at the beginning of the sixteenth century duringwhich the new learning was being vigorously disseminated in france england and germanywithout having become involved in theological controversy this northern renaissance was inmany ways very different from that of italy it was not anarchic or amoral on the contrary it wasassociated with piety and public virtue it was much interested in applying standards ofscholarship to the bible and in obtaining a more accurate text than that of the vulgate it was lessbrilliant and more solid than its italian progenitor less concerned with personal display oflearning and more anxious to spread learning as widely as possible two men erasmus and sir thomas more will serve as exemplars of the northern renaissance they were close friends and had much in common both were learned though more less so than erasmus both despised the scholastic philosophy both aimed at ecclesiastical reform fromwithin but deplored the protestant schism when it came both were witty humourous and highlyskilled writers before luthers revolt they were leaders of thought but after it the world was tooviolent on both sides for men of their type more suffered martyrdom and erasmus sank intoineffectiveness neither erasmus nor more was a philosopher in the strict sense of the word my reason forspeaking of them is that they illustrate the temper of a prerevolutionary age when there is awidespread demand for moderate reform and timid men have not yet been frightened into reactionby extremists they exemplify also the dislike of everything systematic in theology or philosophywhich characterized the reaction against scholasticism erasmus was born at rotterdam he was illegitimate and invented aromantically untrue account of the circumstances of his birth in fact his father was a priest aman of some learning with a knowledge of greek his parents died before he was grown upand his guardians cajoled him intobecoming a monk at the monastery of steyr a step which he regretted all the rest of his life one of his guardians was a schoolmaster but knew less latin than erasmus already knew as aschoolboy in reply to a latin epistle from the boy the schoolmaster wrote if you shouldwrite again so elegantly please to add a commentary in he became secretary to the bishop of cambrai who was chancellor of the order of the golden fleece this gave him the opportunity to leave the monastery and travel though not to italy as he had hoped his knowledge of greek was as yet very slight but he was a highlyaccomplished latinist he particularly admired lorenzo valla on account of his book on theelegancies of the latin language he considered latinity quite compatible with true devotionand instanced augustine and jeromeforgetting apparently the dream in which our lorddenounced the latter for reading cicero he was for a time at the university of paris but found nothing there that was of profit tohimself the university had had its great days from the beginning of scholasticism to gersonand the conciliar movement but now the old disputes had become arid thomists and scotistswho jointly were called the ancients disputed against occamists who were called the terminists or moderns at last in they were reconciled and made common causeagainst the humanists who were making headway in paris outside university circles erasmushated the scholastics whom he regarded as superannuated and antiquated he mentioned in aletter that as he wanted to obtain the doctors degree he tried to say nothing either graceful orwitty he did not really like any philosophy not even plato and aristotle though they beingancients had to be spoken of with respect in he made his first visit to england where he liked the fashion of kissing girls in england he made friends with colet and more who encouraged him to undertake serious workrather than  as regards the life of erasmus i have mainly followed the excellent biography by huizinga

nevertheless there soon came to be much more liberty of speculation in protestant than in catholiccountries because in protestant countries the clergy had less power the important aspect of protestantism was schism not heresy for schism led to national churches and national churcheswere not strong enough to control the lay government this was wholly a gain for the churcheseverywhere opposed as long as they could practically every innovation that made for an increaseof happiness or knowledge here on earth copernicus was not in a position to give any conclusive evidence in favour of his hypothesis andfor a long time astronomers rejected it the next astronomer of importance was tycho brahe who adopted an intermediate position he held that the sun and moon go round theearth but the planets go round the sun as regards theory he was not very original he gavehowever two good reasons against aristotles view that everything above the moon is unchanging one of these was the appearance of a new star in which was found to have no daily parallaxand must therefore be more distant than the moon the other reason was derived from observationof comets which were also found to be distant the reader will remember aristotles doctrine thatchange and decay are confined to the sublunary sphere this like everything else that aristotle saidon scientific subjects proved an obstacle to progress the importance of tycho brahe was not as a theorist but as an observer first under the patronageof the king of denmark then under the emperor rudolf ii he made a star catalogue and notedthe positions of the planets throughout many years towards the end of his life kepler then ayoung man became his assistant to kepler his observations were invaluable kepler is one of the most notable examples of what can be achieved by patiencewithout much in the way of genius he was the first important astronomer after copernicus toadopt the heliocentric theory but tycho brahes data showed that it could not be quite right in theform given to it by copernicus he was influenced by pythagoreanism and more or less fancifullyinclined to sunworship though a good protestant these motives no doubt gave him a bias infavour of the heliocentric hypothesis his pythagoreanism also inclined him to follow plato timaeus in supposing that cosmic significance must attach to the five regular solids he used them to suggest hypotheses to his mind at last by good luck one of these worked keplers great achievement was the discovery of his three laws of planetary motion two of thesehe published in and the third in his first law states the planets describe ellipticorbits of which the sun occupies one focus his second law states the line joining a planet to thesun sweeps out equal areas in equal times his third law states the square of the period ofrevolution of a planet is proportioned to the cube of its average distance from the sun something must be said in explanation of the importance of these laws the first two laws in keplers time could only be proved in the case of mars as regards the otherplanets the observations were compatible with them but not such as to establish them definitely it was not long however before decisive confirmation was found the discovery of the first law that the planets move in ellipses required a greater effort ofemancipation from tradition than a modern man can easily realize the one thing upon which allastronomers without exception had been agreed was that all celestial motions are circular orcompounded of circular motions where circles were found inadequate to explain planetarymotions epicycles were used an epicycle is the curve traced by a point on a circle which rolls onanother circle for example take a big wheel and fasten it flat on the ground take a smaller wheelwhich has a nail through it and roll the smaller wheel round the bigwheel with the point of the nail touching the ground then the mark of the nail in the ground willtrace out an epicycle the orbit of the moon in relation to the sun is roughly of this kindapproximately the earth describes a circle round the sun and the moon meanwhile describes acircle round the earth but this is only an approximation as observation grew more exact it wasfound that no system of epicycles would exactly fit the facts keplers hypothesis he found wasfar more closely in accord with the recorded positions of mars than was that of ptolemy or eventhat of copernicus the substitution of ellipses for circles involved the abandonment of the sthetic bias which hadgoverned astronomy ever since pythagoras the circle was a perfect figure and the celestial orbswere perfect bodiesoriginally gods and even in plato and aristotle closely 
them to suggest hypotheses to his mind at last by good luck one of these worked keplers great achievement was the discovery of his three laws of planetary motion two of thesehe published in and the third in his first law states the planets describe ellipticorbits of which the sun occupies one focus his second law states the line joining a planet to thesun sweeps out equal areas in equal times his third law states the square of the period ofrevolution of a planet is proportioned to the cube of its average distance from the sun something must be said in explanation of the importance of these laws the first two laws in keplers time could only be proved in the case of mars as regards the otherplanets the observations were compatible with them but not such as to establish them definitely it was not long however before decisive confirmation was found the discovery of the first law that the planets move in ellipses required a greater effort ofemancipation from tradition than a modern man can easily realize the one thing upon which allastronomers without exception had been agreed was that all celestial motions are circular orcompounded of circular motions where circles were found inadequate to explain planetarymotions epicycles were used an epicycle is the curve traced by a point on a circle which rolls onanother circle for example take a big wheel and fasten it flat on the ground take a smaller wheelwhich has a nail through it and roll the smaller wheel round the bigwheel with the point of the nail touching the ground then the mark of the nail in the ground willtrace out an epicycle the orbit of the moon in relation to the sun is roughly of this kindapproximately the earth describes a circle round the sun and the moon meanwhile describes acircle round the earth but this is only an approximation as observation grew more exact it wasfound that no system of epicycles would exactly fit the facts keplers hypothesis he found wasfar more closely in accord with the recorded positions of mars than was that of ptolemy or eventhat of copernicus the substitution of ellipses for circles involved the abandonment of the sthetic bias which hadgoverned astronomy ever since pythagoras the circle was a perfect figure and the celestial orbswere perfect bodiesoriginally gods and even in plato and aristotle closely related to gods it seemed obvious that a perfect body must move in a perfect figure moreoversince the heavenly bodies move freely without being pushed or pulled their motion must benatural now it was easy to suppose that there is something natural about a circle but notabout an ellipse thus many deepseated prejudices had to be discarded before keplers first lawcould be accepted no ancient not even aristarchus of samos had anticipated such an hypothesis the second law deals with the varying velocity of the planet at different points of its orbit if s isthe sun and p  p  p  p  p are successive positions of the planet at equal intervals oftimesay at intervals of a monththen keplers law states that the areas p sp  p sp  p sp  p sp are all equal the planet therefore moves fastest when it is nearest to the sun andslowest when it is farthest from it this again was shocking a planet ought to be too stately tohurry at one time and dawdle at another the third law was important because it compared the movements of different planets whereas thefirst two laws dealt with the several planets singly the third law says if r is the average distanceof a planet from the sun and t is the length of its year then r divided by t is the same for allthe different planets this law afforded the proof of newtons law of the inverse square for gravitation but of this we shall speak later galileo is the greatest of the founders of modern science with the possibleexception of newton he was born on about the day on which michelangelo died and he died inthe year in which newton was born i commend these facts to those who still believe inmetempsychosis he is important as an astronomer but perhaps even more as the founder ofdynamics galileo first discovered the importance of acceleration in dynamics acceleration means changeof velocity whether in magnitude or direction thus a body moving uniformly in a circle has at alltimes an acceleration towards the centre of the circle in the language that had been customarybefore his time we might say that he treated uniform motion in a straight line as alone naturalwhether on earth or in the heavens it had been thought natural for heavenly bodies to move incircles and for terrestrial bodies to move in straight lines but moving terrestrial bodies it wasthought would gradually cease to move if they were let alone galileo held as against this viewthat 
related to gods it seemed obvious that a perfect body must move in a perfect figure moreoversince the heavenly bodies move freely without being pushed or pulled their motion must benatural now it was easy to suppose that there is something natural about a circle but notabout an ellipse thus many deepseated prejudices had to be discarded before keplers first lawcould be accepted no ancient not even aristarchus of samos had anticipated such an hypothesis the second law deals with the varying velocity of the planet at different points of its orbit if s isthe sun and p  p  p  p  p are successive positions of the planet at equal intervals oftimesay at intervals of a monththen keplers law states that the areas p sp  p sp  p sp  p sp are all equal the planet therefore moves fastest when it is nearest to the sun andslowest when it is farthest from it this again was shocking a planet ought to be too stately tohurry at one time and dawdle at another the third law was important because it compared the movements of different planets whereas thefirst two laws dealt with the several planets singly the third law says if r is the average distanceof a planet from the sun and t is the length of its year then r divided by t is the same for allthe different planets this law afforded the proof of newtons law of the inverse square for gravitation but of this we shall speak later galileo is the greatest of the founders of modern science with the possibleexception of newton he was born on about the day on which michelangelo died and he died inthe year in which newton was born i commend these facts to those who still believe inmetempsychosis he is important as an astronomer but perhaps even more as the founder ofdynamics galileo first discovered the importance of acceleration in dynamics acceleration means changeof velocity whether in magnitude or direction thus a body moving uniformly in a circle has at alltimes an acceleration towards the centre of the circle in the language that had been customarybefore his time we might say that he treated uniform motion in a straight line as alone naturalwhether on earth or in the heavens it had been thought natural for heavenly bodies to move incircles and for terrestrial bodies to move in straight lines but moving terrestrial bodies it wasthought would gradually cease to move if they were let alone galileo held as against this viewthat every body if let alone will continue to move in a straight line with uniform velocity any changeeither in the rapidity or the direction of motion requires to be explained as due to the action ofsome force this principle was enunciated by newton as the first law of motion it is alsocalled the law of inertia i shall return to its purport later but first something must be said as to thedetail of galileos discoveries galileo was the first to establish the law of falling bodies this law given the concept ofacceleration is of the utmost simplicity it says that when a body is falling freely itsacceleration is constant except in so far as the resistance of the air may interfere further theacceleration is the same for all bodies heavy or light great or small the complete proof of thislaw was not possible until the air pump had been invented which was about after this itwas possible to observe bodies falling in what was practically a vacuum and it was found thatfeathers fell as fast as lead what galileo proved was that there is no measurable differencebetween large and small lumps of the same substance until his time it had been supposed that alarge lump of lead would fall much quicker than a small one but galileo proved by experimentthat this is not the case measurement in his day was not such an accurate business as it has sincebecome nevertheless he arrived at the true law of falling bodies if a body is falling freely in avacuum its velocity increases at a constant rate at the end of the first second its velocity will be feet per second at the end of another second feet per second at the end of the third feetper second and so on the acceleration ie the rate at which the velocity increases is always thesame in each second the increase of velocity is feet per second galileo also studied projectiles a subject of importance to his employer the duke of tuscany ithad been thought that a projectile fired horizontally will move horizontally for a while and thensuddenly begin to fall vertically galileo showed that apart from the resistance of the air thehorizontal velocity would remain constant in accordance with the law of inertia but a verticalvelocity would be added which would grow according to the law of falling bodies to find outhow the projectile will move during some short time say a second after it has been in flight forsome time we proceed as follows first if it were not falling it would cover a certain horizontaldistance 
every body if let alone will continue to move in a straight line with uniform velocity any changeeither in the rapidity or the direction of motion requires to be explained as due to the action ofsome force this principle was enunciated by newton as the first law of motion it is alsocalled the law of inertia i shall return to its purport later but first something must be said as to thedetail of galileos discoveries galileo was the first to establish the law of falling bodies this law given the concept ofacceleration is of the utmost simplicity it says that when a body is falling freely itsacceleration is constant except in so far as the resistance of the air may interfere further theacceleration is the same for all bodies heavy or light great or small the complete proof of thislaw was not possible until the air pump had been invented which was about after this itwas possible to observe bodies falling in what was practically a vacuum and it was found thatfeathers fell as fast as lead what galileo proved was that there is no measurable differencebetween large and small lumps of the same substance until his time it had been supposed that alarge lump of lead would fall much quicker than a small one but galileo proved by experimentthat this is not the case measurement in his day was not such an accurate business as it has sincebecome nevertheless he arrived at the true law of falling bodies if a body is falling freely in avacuum its velocity increases at a constant rate at the end of the first second its velocity will be feet per second at the end of another second feet per second at the end of the third feetper second and so on the acceleration ie the rate at which the velocity increases is always thesame in each second the increase of velocity is feet per second galileo also studied projectiles a subject of importance to his employer the duke of tuscany ithad been thought that a projectile fired horizontally will move horizontally for a while and thensuddenly begin to fall vertically galileo showed that apart from the resistance of the air thehorizontal velocity would remain constant in accordance with the law of inertia but a verticalvelocity would be added which would grow according to the law of falling bodies to find outhow the projectile will move during some short time say a second after it has been in flight forsome time we proceed as follows first if it were not falling it would cover a certain horizontaldistance equal to that which it covered in the first second of its flight second if it were not movinghorizontally but merely falling it would fall vertically with a velocity proportional to the timesince the flight began in fact its change of place is what it would be if it first moved horizontallyfor a second with the initial velocity and then fell vertically for a second with a velocityproportional to the time during which it has been in flight a simple calculation shows that itsconsequent course is a parabola and this is confirmed by observation except in so far as theresistance of the air interferes the above gives a simple instance of a principle which proved immensely fruitful in dynamicsthe principle that when several forces act simultaneously the effect is as if each acted in turn this is part of a more general principle called the parallelogram law suppose for example thatyou are on the deck of a moving ship and you walk across the deck while you are walking theship has moved on so that in relation to the water you have moved both forward and across thedirection of the ships motion if you want to know where you will have got to in relation to thewater you may suppose that first you stood still while the ship moved and then for an equal timethe ship stood still while you walked across it the same principle applies to forces this makes itpossible to work out the total effect of a number of forces and makes it feasible to analysephysical phenomena discovering the separate laws of the several forces to which moving bodiesare subject it was galileo who introduced this immensely fruitful method in what i have been saying i have tried to speak as nearly as possible in the language of theseventeenth century modern language is different in important respects but to explain what theseventeenth century achieved it is desirable to adopt its modes of expression for the time being the law of inertia explained a puzzle which before galileo the copernican system had beenunable to explain as observed above if you drop a stone from the top of a tower it will fall at thefoot of the tower not somewhat to the west of it yet if the earth is rotating it ought to haveslipped away a certain distance during the fall of the stone the reason this does not happen is thatthe stone retains the velocity of rotation which before being dropped it shared with everythingelse on the earths surface in fact if the tower were high 
equal to that which it covered in the first second of its flight second if it were not movinghorizontally but merely falling it would fall vertically with a velocity proportional to the timesince the flight began in fact its change of place is what it would be if it first moved horizontallyfor a second with the initial velocity and then fell vertically for a second with a velocityproportional to the time during which it has been in flight a simple calculation shows that itsconsequent course is a parabola and this is confirmed by observation except in so far as theresistance of the air interferes the above gives a simple instance of a principle which proved immensely fruitful in dynamicsthe principle that when several forces act simultaneously the effect is as if each acted in turn this is part of a more general principle called the parallelogram law suppose for example thatyou are on the deck of a moving ship and you walk across the deck while you are walking theship has moved on so that in relation to the water you have moved both forward and across thedirection of the ships motion if you want to know where you will have got to in relation to thewater you may suppose that first you stood still while the ship moved and then for an equal timethe ship stood still while you walked across it the same principle applies to forces this makes itpossible to work out the total effect of a number of forces and makes it feasible to analysephysical phenomena discovering the separate laws of the several forces to which moving bodiesare subject it was galileo who introduced this immensely fruitful method in what i have been saying i have tried to speak as nearly as possible in the language of theseventeenth century modern language is different in important respects but to explain what theseventeenth century achieved it is desirable to adopt its modes of expression for the time being the law of inertia explained a puzzle which before galileo the copernican system had beenunable to explain as observed above if you drop a stone from the top of a tower it will fall at thefoot of the tower not somewhat to the west of it yet if the earth is rotating it ought to haveslipped away a certain distance during the fall of the stone the reason this does not happen is thatthe stone retains the velocity of rotation which before being dropped it shared with everythingelse on the earths surface in fact if the tower were high enough there would be the opposite effect to that expected by the opponents of copernicus thetop of the tower being further from the centre of the earth than the bottom is moving faster andtherefore the stone should fall slightly to the east of the foot of the tower this effect howeverwould be too slight to be measurable galileo ardently adopted the heliocentric system he corresponded with kepler and accepted hisdiscoveries having heard that a dutchman had lately invented a telescope galileo made onehimself and very quickly discovered a number of important things he found that the milky wayconsists of a multitude of separate stars he observed the phases of venus which copernicusknew to be implied by his theory but which the naked eye was unable to perceive he discoveredthe satellites of jupiter which in honour of his employer he called sidera medicea it was foundthat these satellites obey keplers laws there was however a difficulty there had always beenseven heavenly bodies the five planets and the sun and moon now seven is a sacred number isnot the sabbath the seventh day were there not the sevenbranched candlesticks and the sevenchurches of asia what then could be more appropriate than that there should be seven heavenlybodies but if we have to add jupiters four moons that makes elevena number which has nomystic properties on this ground the traditionalists denounced the telescope refused to lookthrough it and maintained that it revealed only delusions galileo wrote to kepler wishing theycould have a good laugh together at the stupidity of the mob the rest of his letter makes it plainthat the mob consisted of the professors of philosophy who tried to conjure away jupitersmoons using logicchopping arguments as though they were magical incantations galileo as every one knows was condemned by the inquisition first privately in and thenpublicly in on which latter occasion he recanted and promised never again to maintain thatthe earth rotates or revolves the inquisition was successful in putting an end to science in italywhich did not revive there for centuries but it failed to prevent men of science from adopting theheliocentric theory and did considerable damage to the church by its stupidity fortunately therewere protestant countries where the clergy however anxious to do harm to science were unableto gain control of the state 
enough there would be the opposite effect to that expected by the opponents of copernicus thetop of the tower being further from the centre of the earth than the bottom is moving faster andtherefore the stone should fall slightly to the east of the foot of the tower this effect howeverwould be too slight to be measurable galileo ardently adopted the heliocentric system he corresponded with kepler and accepted hisdiscoveries having heard that a dutchman had lately invented a telescope galileo made onehimself and very quickly discovered a number of important things he found that the milky wayconsists of a multitude of separate stars he observed the phases of venus which copernicusknew to be implied by his theory but which the naked eye was unable to perceive he discoveredthe satellites of jupiter which in honour of his employer he called sidera medicea it was foundthat these satellites obey keplers laws there was however a difficulty there had always beenseven heavenly bodies the five planets and the sun and moon now seven is a sacred number isnot the sabbath the seventh day were there not the sevenbranched candlesticks and the sevenchurches of asia what then could be more appropriate than that there should be seven heavenlybodies but if we have to add jupiters four moons that makes elevena number which has nomystic properties on this ground the traditionalists denounced the telescope refused to lookthrough it and maintained that it revealed only delusions galileo wrote to kepler wishing theycould have a good laugh together at the stupidity of the mob the rest of his letter makes it plainthat the mob consisted of the professors of philosophy who tried to conjure away jupitersmoons using logicchopping arguments as though they were magical incantations galileo as every one knows was condemned by the inquisition first privately in and thenpublicly in on which latter occasion he recanted and promised never again to maintain thatthe earth rotates or revolves the inquisition was successful in putting an end to science in italywhich did not revive there for centuries but it failed to prevent men of science from adopting theheliocentric theory and did considerable damage to the church by its stupidity fortunately therewere protestant countries where the clergy however anxious to do harm to science were unableto gain control of the state newton achieved the final and complete triumph for which copernicus keplerand galileo had prepared the way starting from his three laws of motionof which the first twoare due to galileohe proved that keplers three laws are equivalent to the proposition thatevery planet at every moment has an acceleration towards the sun which varies inversely as thesquare of the distance from the sun he showed that accelerations towards the earth and the sunfollowing the same formula explain the moons motion and that the acceleration of fallingbodies on the earths surface is again related to that of the moon according to the inverse squarelaw he defined force as the cause of change of motion ie of acceleration he was thus ableto enunciate his law of universal gravitation every body attracts every other with a forcedirectly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square ofthe distance between them from this formula he was able to deduce everything in planetarytheory the motions of the planets and their satellites the orbits of comets the tides it appearedlater that even the minute departures from elliptical orbits on the part of the planets werededucible from newtons law the triumph was so complete that newton was in danger ofbecoming another aristotle and imposing an insuperable barrier to progress in england it wasnot till a century after his death that men freed themselves from his authority sufficiently to doimportant original work in the subjects of which he had treated the seventeenth century was remarkable not only in astronomy and dynamics but in manyother ways connected with science take first the question of scientific instruments the compound microscope was invented justbefore the seventeenth century about the telescope was invented in by a dutchman named lippershey though it was galileo who first made serious use of it forscientific purposes galileo also invented the thermometerat least this seems most probable his pupil torricelli invented the barometer guericke invented the air pump clocksthough not new were greatly improved in the seventeenth century largely by the work of galileo owing to these inventions scientific observa  on this subject see the chapter scientific instruments in a history of science technology and philosophy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by a wolf 
newton achieved the final and complete triumph for which copernicus keplerand galileo had prepared the way starting from his three laws of motionof which the first twoare due to galileohe proved that keplers three laws are equivalent to the proposition thatevery planet at every moment has an acceleration towards the sun which varies inversely as thesquare of the distance from the sun he showed that accelerations towards the earth and the sunfollowing the same formula explain the moons motion and that the acceleration of fallingbodies on the earths surface is again related to that of the moon according to the inverse squarelaw he defined force as the cause of change of motion ie of acceleration he was thus ableto enunciate his law of universal gravitation every body attracts every other with a forcedirectly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square ofthe distance between them from this formula he was able to deduce everything in planetarytheory the motions of the planets and their satellites the orbits of comets the tides it appearedlater that even the minute departures from elliptical orbits on the part of the planets werededucible from newtons law the triumph was so complete that newton was in danger ofbecoming another aristotle and imposing an insuperable barrier to progress in england it wasnot till a century after his death that men freed themselves from his authority sufficiently to doimportant original work in the subjects of which he had treated the seventeenth century was remarkable not only in astronomy and dynamics but in manyother ways connected with science take first the question of scientific instruments the compound microscope was invented justbefore the seventeenth century about the telescope was invented in by a dutchman named lippershey though it was galileo who first made serious use of it forscientific purposes galileo also invented the thermometerat least this seems most probable his pupil torricelli invented the barometer guericke invented the air pump clocksthough not new were greatly improved in the seventeenth century largely by the work of galileo owing to these inventions scientific observa  on this subject see the chapter scientific instruments in a history of science technology and philosophy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by a wolf tion became immensely more exact and more extensive than it had been at any former time next there was important work in other sciences than astronomy and dynamics gilbert published his great book on the magnet in harvey discovered thecirculation of the blood and published his discovery in leeuwenhoek discovered spermatozoa though another man stephen hamm had discovered them apparently afew months earlier leeuwenhoek also discovered protozoa or unicellular organisms and evenbacteria robert boyle was as children were taught when i was young the father ofchemistry and son of the earl of cork he is now chiefly remembered on account of boyles law that in a given quantity of gas at a given temperature pressure is inversely proportional tovolume i have hitherto said nothing of the advances in pure mathematics but these were very great indeedand were indispensable to much of the work in the physical sciences napier published hisinvention of logarithms in coordinate geometry resulted from the work of severalseventeenthcentury mathematicians among whom the greatest contribution was made by descartes the differential and integral calculus was invented independently by newton and leibniz it is the instrument for almost all higher mathematics these are only the mostoutstanding achievements in pure mathematics there were innumerable others of greatimportance the consequence of the scientific work we have been considering was that the outlook ofeducated men was completely transformed at the beginning of the century sir thomas brownetook part in trials for witchcraft at the end such a thing would have been impossible in shakespeares time comets were still portents after the publication of newton principia in it was known that he and halley had calculated the orbits of certain comets and that they were asobedient as the planets to the law of gravitation the reign of law had established its hold onmens imaginations making such things as magic and sorcery incredible in the mentaloutlook of educated men was completely modern in except among a very few it was stilllargely medieval in the remainder of this chapter i shall try to state briefly the philosophical beliefs which appearedto follow from seventeenth

century science and some of the respects in which modern science differs from that of newton the first thing to note is the removal of almost all traces of animism from the laws of physics the greeks though they did not say so explicitly evidently considered the power of movement a signof life to commonsense observation it seems that animals move themselves while dead matteronly moves when impelled by an external force the soul of an animal in aristotle has variousfunctions and one of them is to move the animals body the sun and planets in greek thinkingare apt to be gods or at least regulated and moved by gods anaxagoras thought otherwise butwas impious democritus thought otherwise but was neglected except by the epicureans infavour of plato and aristotle aristotles fortyseven or fiftyfive unmoved movers are divinespirits and are the ultimate source of all the motion in the universe left to itself any inanimatebody would soon become motionless thus the operation of soul on matter has to be continuous ifmotion is not to cease all this was changed by the first law of motion lifeless matter once set moving will continue tomove for ever unless stopped by some external cause moreover the external causes of change ofmotion turned out to be themselves material whenever they could be definitely ascertained thesolar system at any rate was kept going by its own momentum and its own laws no outsideinterference was needed there might still seem to be need of god to set the mechanism workingthe planets according to newton were originally hurled by the hand of god but when he haddone this and decreed the law of gravitation everything went on by itself without further need ofdivine intervention when laplace suggested that the same forces which are now operative mighthave caused the planets to grow out of the sun gods share in the course of nature was pushed stillfurther back he might remain as creator but even that was doubtful since it was not clear thatthe world had a beginning in time although most of the men of science were models of piety theoutlook suggested by their work was disturbing to orthodoxy and the theologians were quitejustified in feeling uneasy another thing that resulted from science was a profound change in the conception of mans placein the universe in the medieval world the earth was the centre of the heavens and everything hada purpose concerned with man in the newtonian world the earth was a minor planet of a not speciallydistinguished star astronomical distances were so vast that the earth in comparison was a merepinpoint it seemed unlikely that this immense apparatus was all designed for the good of certainsmall creatures on this pinpoint moreover purpose which had since aristotle formed an intimatepart of the conception of science was now thrust out of scientific procedure any one might stillbelieve that the heavens exist to declare the glory of god but no one could let this belief intervenein an astronomical calculation the world might have a purpose but purposes could no longerenter into scientific explanations the copernican theory should have been humbling to human pride but in fact the contrary effectwas produced for the triumphs of science revived human pride the dying ancient world had beenobsessed with a sense of sin and had bequeathed this as an oppression to the middle ages to behumble before god was both right and prudent for god would punish pride pestilences floodsearthquakes turks tartars and comets perplexed the gloomy centuries and it was felt that onlygreater and greater humility would avert these real or threatened calamities but it becameimpossible to remain humble when men were achieving such triumphs nature and natures laws lay hid in night god said let newton be and all was light and as for damnation surely the creator of so vast a universe had something better to think aboutthan sending men to hell for minute theological errors judas iscariot might be damned but not newton though he were an arian there were of course many other reasons for selfsatisfaction the tartars had been confined to asia and the turks were ceasing to be a menace comets had been humbled by halley and as forearthquakes though they were still formidable they were so interesting that men of science couldhardly regret them western europeans were growing rapidly richer and were becoming lords ofall the world they had conquered north and south america they were powerful in africa and india respected in china and feared in japan when to all this were added the triumphs ofscience it is no wonder that the men of the seventeenth century felt themselves to be fine

fellows not the miserable sinners that they still proclaimed themselves on sundays there are some respects in which the concepts of modern theoretical physics differ from those ofthe newtonian system to begin with the conception of force which is prominent in theseventeenth century has been found to be superfluous force in newton is the cause of changeof motion whether in magnitude or direction the notion of cause is regarded as important andforce is conceived imaginatively as the sort of thing that we experience when we push or pull forthis reason it was considered an objection to gravitation that it acted at a distance and newtonhimself conceded that there must be some medium by which it was transmitted gradually it wasfound that all the equations could be written down without bringing in forces what wasobservable was a certain relation between acceleration and configuration to say that this relationwas brought about by the intermediacy of force was to add nothing to our knowledge observation shows that planets have at all times an acceleration towards the sun which variesinversely as the square of their distance from it to say that this is due to the force of gravitationis merely verbal like saying that opium makes people sleep because it has a dormitive virtue themodern physicist therefore merely states formul which determine accelerations and avoids theword force altogether force was the faint ghost of the vitalist view as to the causes ofmotions and gradually the ghost has been exorcized until the coming of quantum mechanics nothing happened to modify in any degree what is theessential purport of the first two laws of motion namely this that the laws of dynamics are to bestated in terms of accelerations in this respect copernicus and kepler are still to be classed withthe ancients they sought laws stating the shapes of the orbits of the heavenly bodies newtonmade it clear that laws stated in this form could never be more than approximate the planets donot move in exact ellipses because of the perturbations caused by the attractions of other planets nor is the orbit of a planet ever exactly repeated for the same reason but the law of gravitationwhich deals with accelerations was very simple and was thought to be quite exact until twohundred years after newtons time when it was emended by einstein it still remained a lawdealing with accelerations it is true that the conservation of energy is a law dealing with velocities not accelerations but incalculations which use this law it is still accelerations that have to be employed as for the changes introduced by quantum mechanics they are very profound but still to somedegree a matter of controversy and uncertainty there is one change from the newtonian philosophy which must be mentioned now and that isthe abandonment of absolute space and time the reader will remember a mention of this questionin connection with democritus newton believed in a space composed of points and a timecomposed of instants which had an existence independent of the bodies and events that occupiedthem as regards space he had an empirical argument to support his view namely that

he was an average man no better and noworse than the bulk of his contemporaries after five years spent in retirement he died of a chill caught while experimenting on refrigerationby stuffing a chicken full of snow bacons most important book the advancement of learning is in many ways remarkablymodern he is commonly regarded as the originator of the saying knowledge is power andthough he may have had predecessors who said the same thing he said it with new emphasis thewhole basis of his philosophy was practical to give mankind mastery over the forces of nature bymeans of scientific discoveries and inventions he held that philosophy should be kept separatefrom theology not intimately blended with it as in scholasticism he accepted orthodox religionhe was not the man to quarrel with the government on such a matter but while he thought thatreason could show the existence of god he regarded everything else in theology as known only byrevelation indeed he held that the triumph of faith is greatest when to the unaided reason a dogmaappears most absurd philosophy however should depend only upon reason he was thus anadvocate of the doctrine of double truth that of reason and that of revelation this doctrine hadbeen preached by certain averroists in the thirteenth century but had been condemned by the church the triumph of faith was for the orthodox a dangerous device bayle in the lateseventeenth century made ironical use of it setting forth at great length all that reason could sayagainst some orthodox belief and then concluding so much the greater is the triumph of faith

bacon was the first of the long line of scientifically minded philosophers who have emphasizedthe importance of induction as opposed to deduction like most of his successors he tried to findsome better kind of induction than what is called induction by simple enumeration induction bysimple enumeration may be illustrated by a parable there was once upon a time a census officerwho had to record the names of all householders in a certain welsh village the first that hequestioned was called william williams so were the second third fourth  at last he said tohimself this is tedious evidently they are all called william williams i shall put them down soand take a holiday but he was wrong there was just one whose name was john jones thisshows that we may go astray if we trust too implicitly in induction by simple enumeration bacon believed that he had a method by which induction could be made something better thanthis he wished for example to discover the nature of heat which he supposed to consistof rapid irregular motions of the small parts of bodies his method was to make lists of hot bodieslists of cold bodies and lists of bodies of varying degrees of heat he hoped that these lists wouldshow some characteristic always present in hot bodies and absent in cold bodies and present invarying degrees in bodies of different degress of heat by this method he expected to arrive atgeneral laws having in the first instance the lowest degree of generality from a number of suchlaws he hoped to reach laws of the second degree of generality and so on a suggested law shouldbe tested by being applied in new circumstances if it worked in these circumstances it was to thatextent confirmed some instances are specially valuable because they enable us to decide betweentwo theories each possible so far as previous observations are concerned such instances arecalled prerogative instances bacon not only despised the syllogism but undervalued mathematics presumably as insufficientlyexperimental he was virulently hostile to aristotle but thought very highly of democritus although he did not deny that the course of nature exemplifies a divine purpose he objected toany admixture of teleological explanation in the actual investigation of phenomena everything heheld should be explained as following necessarily from efficient causes he valued his method as showing how to arrange the observational data upon which science must be based we ought he says to be neither like spiders which spinthings out of their own insides nor like ants which merely collect but like bees which bothcollect and arrange this is somewhat unfair to the ants but it illustrates bacons meaning one of the most famous parts of bacons philosophy is his enumeration of what he calls idolsby which he means bad habits of mind that cause people to fall into error of these he enumeratesfive kinds idols of the tribe are those that are inherent in human nature he mentions inparticular the habit of expecting more order in natural phenomena than is actually to be foundidols of the cave are personal prejudices characteristic of the particular investigator idols ofthe marketplace are those that have to do with the tyranny of words and the difficulty ofescaping from their influence over our minds idols of the theatre are those that have to do withreceived systems of thought of these naturally aristotle and the scholastics afforded him themost noteworthy instances lastly there are idols of the schools which consist in thinking thatsome blind rule can take the place of judgement in investigation although science was what interested bacon and although his general outlook was scientific hemissed most of what was being done in science in his day he rejected the copernican theorywhich was excusable so far as copernicus himself was concerned since he did not advance anyvery solid arguments but bacon ought to have been convinced by kepler whose new astronomyappeared in bacon appears not to have known of the work of vesalius the pioneer ofmodern anatomy or of gilbert whose work on magnetism brilliantly illustrated inductive method still more surprising he seemed unconscious of the work of harvey although harvey was hismedical attendant it is true that harvey did not publish his discovery of the circulation of theblood until after bacons death but one would have supposed that bacon would have been awareof his researches harvey had no very high opinion of him saying he writes philosophy like a lord chancellor no doubt bacon could have done better if he had been less concerned withworldly success bacons inductive method is faulty through insufficient emphasis on hypothesis he hoped thatmere orderly arrangement of data would make the right hypothesis obvious but this is seldom thecase as a 
data upon which science must be based we ought he says to be neither like spiders which spinthings out of their own insides nor like ants which merely collect but like bees which bothcollect and arrange this is somewhat unfair to the ants but it illustrates bacons meaning one of the most famous parts of bacons philosophy is his enumeration of what he calls idolsby which he means bad habits of mind that cause people to fall into error of these he enumeratesfive kinds idols of the tribe are those that are inherent in human nature he mentions inparticular the habit of expecting more order in natural phenomena than is actually to be foundidols of the cave are personal prejudices characteristic of the particular investigator idols ofthe marketplace are those that have to do with the tyranny of words and the difficulty ofescaping from their influence over our minds idols of the theatre are those that have to do withreceived systems of thought of these naturally aristotle and the scholastics afforded him themost noteworthy instances lastly there are idols of the schools which consist in thinking thatsome blind rule can take the place of judgement in investigation although science was what interested bacon and although his general outlook was scientific hemissed most of what was being done in science in his day he rejected the copernican theorywhich was excusable so far as copernicus himself was concerned since he did not advance anyvery solid arguments but bacon ought to have been convinced by kepler whose new astronomyappeared in bacon appears not to have known of the work of vesalius the pioneer ofmodern anatomy or of gilbert whose work on magnetism brilliantly illustrated inductive method still more surprising he seemed unconscious of the work of harvey although harvey was hismedical attendant it is true that harvey did not publish his discovery of the circulation of theblood until after bacons death but one would have supposed that bacon would have been awareof his researches harvey had no very high opinion of him saying he writes philosophy like a lord chancellor no doubt bacon could have done better if he had been less concerned withworldly success bacons inductive method is faulty through insufficient emphasis on hypothesis he hoped thatmere orderly arrangement of data would make the right hypothesis obvious but this is seldom thecase as a rule the framing of hypotheses is the most difficult part of scientific work and the part wheregreat ability is indispensable so far no method has been found which would make it possible toinvent hypotheses by rule usually some hypothesis is a necessary preliminary to the collection offacts since the selection of facts demands some way of determining relevance without somethingof this kind the mere multiplicity of facts is baffling the part played by deduction in science is greater than bacon supposed often when a hypothesishas to be tested there is a long deductive journey from the hypothesis to some consequence thatcan be tested by observation usually the deduction is mathematical and in this respect baconunderestimated the importance of mathematics in scientific investigation the problem of induction by simple enumeration remains unsolved to this day bacon was quiteright in rejecting simple enumeration where the details of scientific investigation are concernedfor in dealing with details we may assume general laws on the basis of which so long as they aretaken as valid more or less cogent methods can be built up john stuart mill framed four canonsof inductive method which can be usefully employed so long as the law of causality is assumedbut this law itself he had to confess is to be accepted solely on the basis of induction by simpleenumeration the thing that is achieved by the theoretical organization of science is the collectionof all subordinate inductions into a few that are very comprehensive perhaps only one suchcomprehensive inductions are confirmed by so many instances that it is thought legitimate toaccept as regards them an induction by simple enumeration this situation is profoundlyunsatisfactory but neither bacon nor any of his successors have found a way out of it chapter viii hobbess leviathan hobbes is a philosopher whom it is difficult to classify he was an empiricist like locke berkeley and hume but unlike them he was an admirer of mathematical method notonly in pure mathematics but in its applications his general outlook was inspired by galileorather than bacon from descartes to kant continental philosophy derived much of itsconception of the nature of human knowledge from mathematics but it regarded mathematics asknown independently of experience it was thus led like platonism to minimize the part playedby perception and overemphasize the part played by pure thought english empiricism on theother hand was little influenced by mathematics and tended to have a wrong conception ofscientific method hobbes had neither of these defects it is not until our own day that we find anyother philosophers who were empiricists and yet laid due stress on mathematics in this respect hobbess merit is great he has however grave defects which make it impossible to place himquite in the first rank he is impatient of subtleties and too much inclined to cut the gordian knot his solutions of problems are logical but are attained by omitting awkward facts he is vigorousbut crude he wields the battleaxe better than the rapier nevertheless his theory of the statedeserves to be carefully considered the more so as it is more modern than any previous theoryeven that of machiavelli hobbess father was a vicar who was illtempered and uneducated he lost his job by quarrellingwith a neighbouring vicar at the church door after this hobbes was brought up by an uncle heacquired a good knowledge of the classics and translated the medea of euripides into latiniambics at the age of fourteen at

confirmed by so many instances that it is thought legitimate toaccept as regards them an induction by simple enumeration this situation is profoundlyunsatisfactory but neither bacon nor any of his successors have found a way out of it chapter viii hobbess leviathan hobbes is a philosopher whom it is difficult to classify he was an empiricist like locke berkeley and hume but unlike them he was an admirer of mathematical method notonly in pure mathematics but in its applications his general outlook was inspired by galileorather than bacon from descartes to kant continental philosophy derived much of itsconception of the nature of human knowledge from mathematics but it regarded mathematics asknown independently of experience it was thus led like platonism to minimize the part playedby perception and overemphasize the part played by pure thought english empiricism on theother hand was little influenced by mathematics and tended to have a wrong conception ofscientific method hobbes had neither of these defects it is not until our own day that we find anyother philosophers who were empiricists and yet laid due stress on mathematics in this respect hobbess merit is great he has however grave defects which make it impossible to place himquite in the first rank he is impatient of subtleties and too much inclined to cut the gordian knot his solutions of problems are logical but are attained by omitting awkward facts he is vigorousbut crude he wields the battleaxe better than the rapier nevertheless his theory of the statedeserves to be carefully considered the more so as it is more modern than any previous theoryeven that of machiavelli hobbess father was a vicar who was illtempered and uneducated he lost his job by quarrellingwith a neighbouring vicar at the church door after this hobbes was brought up by an uncle heacquired a good knowledge of the classics and translated the medea of euripides into latiniambics at the age of fourteen at fifteen he went to oxford where they taught him scholastic logic and the philosophy of aristotle these were his bugbears in later life and he maintained that he had profited little by his years atthe university indeed universities in general are constantly criticized in his writings in the year when he was twentytwo years old he became tutor to lord hardwick with whom he made the grand tour it was at this time that he began to knowthe work of galileo and kepler which profoundly influenced him his pupil became his patronand remained so until he died in through him hobbes met ben jonson and bacon and lord herbert of cherbury and many other important men after the death of the earl of devonshirewho left a young son hobbes lived for a time in paris where he began the study of euclid thenhe became tutor to his former pupils son with him he travelled to italy where he visited galileoin in he came back to england the political opinions expressed in the leviathan which were royalist in the extreme had beenheld by hobbes for a long time when the parliament of drew up the petition of right hepublished a translation of thucydides with the expressed intention of showing the evils ofdemocracy when the long parliament met in and laud and strafford were sent to the tower hobbes was terrified and fled to france his book de cive written in though notpublished till sets forth essentially the same theory as that of the leviathan it was not theactual occurrence of the civil war that caused his opinions but the prospect of it naturallyhowever his convictions were strengthened when his fears were realized in paris he was welcomed by many of the leading mathematicians and men of science he was oneof those who saw descartes meditations before they were published and wrote objections tothem which were printed by descartes with his replies he also soon had a large company of english royalist refugees with whom to associate for a time from to he taughtmathematics to the future charles ii when however in he published the leviathan itpleased no one its rationalism offended most of the refugees and its bitter attacks on the catholic church offended the french government hobbes therefore fled secretly to london where hemade submission to cromwell and abstained from all political activity

the rights of property are only valid as against other subjects not as against the sovereign thesovereign has the right to regulate foreign trade he is not subject to the civil law his right topunish comes to him not from any concept of justice but because he retains the liberty that allmen had in the state of nature when no man could be blamed for inflicting injury on another there is an interesting list of the reasons for the dissolution ofcommonwealths these are giving too little power to the sovereign allowing private judgementin subjects the theory that everything that is against conscience is sin the belief in inspiration thedoctrine that the sovereign is subject to civil laws the recognition of absolute private propertydivision of the sovereign power imitation of the greeks and romans separation of temporal andspiritual powers refusing the power of taxation to the sovereign the popularity of potent subjectsand the liberty of disputing with the sovereign of all these there were abundant instances in thethen recent history of england and france there should not hobbes thinks be much difficulty in teaching people to believe in the rights ofthe sovereign for have they not been taught to believe in christianity and even intransubstantiation which is contrary to reason there should be days set apart for learning theduty of submission the instruction of the people depends upon right teaching in the universitieswhich must therefore be carefully supervised there must be uniformity of worship the religionbeing that ordained by the sovereign part ii ends with the hope that some sovereign will read the book and make himself absolutealess chimerical hope than platos that some king would turn philosopher monarchs are assuredthat the book is easy reading and quite interesting part iii of a christian commonwealth explains that there is no universal church because the church must depend upon the civil government in each country the king must be head of the church the popes overlordship and infallibility cannot be admitted it argues as might beexpected that a christian who is a subject of a non christian sovereign should yield outwardlyfor was not naaman suffered to bow himself in the house of rimmon part iv of the kingdom of darkness is mainly concerned with criticism of the church of rome which hobbes hates because it puts the spiritual power above the temporal the rest of this part is an attack on vain philosophy bywhich aristotle is usually meant let us now try to decide what we are to think of the leviathan the question is not easy becausethe good and the bad in it are so closely intermingled in politics there are two different questions one as to the best form of the state the other as to itspowers the best form of state according to hobbes is monarchy but this is not the importantpart of his doctrine the important part is his contention that the powers of the state should beabsolute this doctrine or something like it had grown up in western europe during the renaissance and the reformation first the feudal nobility were cowed by louis xi edward ivferdinand and isabella and their successors then the reformation in protestant countriesenabled the lay government to get the better of the church henry viii wielded a power such as noearlier english king had enjoyed but in france the reformation at first had an opposite effectbetween the guises and the huguenots the kings were nearly powerless henry iv and richelieunot long before hobbes wrote had laid the foundations of the absolute monarchy which lasted in france till the revolution in spain charles v had got the better of the cortes and philip ii wasabsolute except in relation to the church in england however the puritans had undone the workof henry viii their work suggested to hobbes that anarchy must result from resistance to thesovereign every community is faced with two dangers anarchy and despotism the puritans especially the independents were most impressed by the danger of despotism hobbes on the contrary wasobsessed by the fear of anarchy the liberal philosophers who arose after the restoration andacquired control after realized both dangers they disliked both strafford and the anabaptists this led locke to the doctrine of division of powers and of checks and balances in england there was a real division of powers so long as the king had influence then parliamentbecame supreme and ultimately the cabinet in america there are still checks and balances in sofar as congress and the supreme court can resist the administration but the tendency is towardsa constant increase in the powers of the administration in germany italy russia and japan thegovernment has even more power than hobbes thought desirable on the 
the spiritual power above the temporal the rest of this part is an attack on vain philosophy bywhich aristotle is usually meant let us now try to decide what we are to think of the leviathan the question is not easy becausethe good and the bad in it are so closely intermingled in politics there are two different questions one as to the best form of the state the other as to itspowers the best form of state according to hobbes is monarchy but this is not the importantpart of his doctrine the important part is his contention that the powers of the state should beabsolute this doctrine or something like it had grown up in western europe during the renaissance and the reformation first the feudal nobility were cowed by louis xi edward ivferdinand and isabella and their successors then the reformation in protestant countriesenabled the lay government to get the better of the church henry viii wielded a power such as noearlier english king had enjoyed but in france the reformation at first had an opposite effectbetween the guises and the huguenots the kings were nearly powerless henry iv and richelieunot long before hobbes wrote had laid the foundations of the absolute monarchy which lasted in france till the revolution in spain charles v had got the better of the cortes and philip ii wasabsolute except in relation to the church in england however the puritans had undone the workof henry viii their work suggested to hobbes that anarchy must result from resistance to thesovereign every community is faced with two dangers anarchy and despotism the puritans especially the independents were most impressed by the danger of despotism hobbes on the contrary wasobsessed by the fear of anarchy the liberal philosophers who arose after the restoration andacquired control after realized both dangers they disliked both strafford and the anabaptists this led locke to the doctrine of division of powers and of checks and balances in england there was a real division of powers so long as the king had influence then parliamentbecame supreme and ultimately the cabinet in america there are still checks and balances in sofar as congress and the supreme court can resist the administration but the tendency is towardsa constant increase in the powers of the administration in germany italy russia and japan thegovernment has even more power than hobbes thought desirable on the whole therefore as regards the powers of the state the world has gone as hobbes wished after along liberal period during which at least apparently it was moving in the opposite direction whatever may be the outcome of the present war it seems evident that the functions of the statemust continue to increase and that resistance to it must grow more and more difficult the reason that hobbes gives for supporting the state namely that it is the only alternative toanarchy is in the main a valid one a state may however be so bad that temporary anarchyseems preferable to its continuance as in france in and in russia in moreover thetendency of every government towards tyranny cannot be kept in check unless governments havesome fear of rebellion governments would be worse than they are if hobbess submissive attitudewere universally adopted by subjects this is true in the political sphere where governments willtry if they can to make themselves personally irremovable it is true in the economic spherewhere they will try to enrich themselves and their friends at the public expense it is true in theintellectual sphere where they will suppress every new discovery or doctrine that seems tomenace their power these are reasons for not thinking only of the risk of anarchy but also of thedanger of injustice and ossification that is bound up with omnipotence in government the merits of hobbes appear most clearly when he is contrasted with earlier political theorists heis completely free from superstition he does not argue from what happened to adam and eve atthe time of the fall he is clear and logical his ethics right or wrong is completely intelligibleand does not involve the use of any dubious concepts apart from machiavelli who is much morelimited he is the first really modern writer on political theory where he is wrong he is wrongfrom oversimplification not because the basis of his thought is unreal and fantastic for thisreason he is still worth refuting without criticizing hobbess metaphysics or ethics there are two points to make against him thefirst is that he always considers the national interest as a whole and assumes tacitly that themajor interests of all citizens are the same he does not realize the importance of the clashbetween different classes which marx makes the chief cause of social change this is connectedwith the assumption that the interests of a monarch are roughly identical with those of his sub 
whole therefore as regards the powers of the state the world has gone as hobbes wished after along liberal period during which at least apparently it was moving in the opposite direction whatever may be the outcome of the present war it seems evident that the functions of the statemust continue to increase and that resistance to it must grow more and more difficult the reason that hobbes gives for supporting the state namely that it is the only alternative toanarchy is in the main a valid one a state may however be so bad that temporary anarchyseems preferable to its continuance as in france in and in russia in moreover thetendency of every government towards tyranny cannot be kept in check unless governments havesome fear of rebellion governments would be worse than they are if hobbess submissive attitudewere universally adopted by subjects this is true in the political sphere where governments willtry if they can to make themselves personally irremovable it is true in the economic spherewhere they will try to enrich themselves and their friends at the public expense it is true in theintellectual sphere where they will suppress every new discovery or doctrine that seems tomenace their power these are reasons for not thinking only of the risk of anarchy but also of thedanger of injustice and ossification that is bound up with omnipotence in government the merits of hobbes appear most clearly when he is contrasted with earlier political theorists heis completely free from superstition he does not argue from what happened to adam and eve atthe time of the fall he is clear and logical his ethics right or wrong is completely intelligibleand does not involve the use of any dubious concepts apart from machiavelli who is much morelimited he is the first really modern writer on political theory where he is wrong he is wrongfrom oversimplification not because the basis of his thought is unreal and fantastic for thisreason he is still worth refuting without criticizing hobbess metaphysics or ethics there are two points to make against him thefirst is that he always considers the national interest as a whole and assumes tacitly that themajor interests of all citizens are the same he does not realize the importance of the clashbetween different classes which marx makes the chief cause of social change this is connectedwith the assumption that the interests of a monarch are roughly identical with those of his sub jects in time of war there is a unification of interests especially if the war is fierce but in time ofpeace the clash may be very great between the interests of one class and those of another it is notby any means always true that in such a situation the best way to avert anarchy is to preach theabsolute power of the sovereign some concession in the way of sharing power may be the onlyway to prevent civil war this should have been obvious to hobbes from the recent history of england another point in which hobbess doctrine is unduly limited is in regard to the relations betweendifferent states there is not a word in leviathan to suggest any relation between them except warand conquest with occasional interludes this follows on his principles from the absence of aninternational government for the relations of states are still in a state of nature which is that of awar of all against all so long as there is international anarchy it is by no means clear that increaseof efficiency in the separate states is in the interest of mankind since it increases the ferocity anddestructiveness of war every argument that he adduces in favour of government in so far as it isvalid at all is valid in favour of international government so long as national states exist andfight each other only inefficiency can preserve the human race to improve the fighting quality ofseparate states without having any means of preventing war is the road to universal destruction chapter ix descartes ren descartes is usually considered the founder of modern philosophyand i think rightly he is the first man of high philosophic capacity whose outlook is profoundlyaffected by the new physics and astronomy while it is true that he retains much of scholasticismhe does not accept foundations laid by predecessors but endeavours to construct a completephilosophic edifice de novo this had not happened since aristotle 
jects in time of war there is a unification of interests especially if the war is fierce but in time ofpeace the clash may be very great between the interests of one class and those of another it is notby any means always true that in such a situation the best way to avert anarchy is to preach theabsolute power of the sovereign some concession in the way of sharing power may be the onlyway to prevent civil war this should have been obvious to hobbes from the recent history of england another point in which hobbess doctrine is unduly limited is in regard to the relations betweendifferent states there is not a word in leviathan to suggest any relation between them except warand conquest with occasional interludes this follows on his principles from the absence of aninternational government for the relations of states are still in a state of nature which is that of awar of all against all so long as there is international anarchy it is by no means clear that increaseof efficiency in the separate states is in the interest of mankind since it increases the ferocity anddestructiveness of war every argument that he adduces in favour of government in so far as it isvalid at all is valid in favour of international government so long as national states exist andfight each other only inefficiency can preserve the human race to improve the fighting quality ofseparate states without having any means of preventing war is the road to universal destruction chapter ix descartes ren descartes is usually considered the founder of modern philosophyand i think rightly he is the first man of high philosophic capacity whose outlook is profoundlyaffected by the new physics and astronomy while it is true that he retains much of scholasticismhe does not accept foundations laid by predecessors but endeavours to construct a completephilosophic edifice de novo this had not happened since aristotle and is a sign of the new selfconfidence that resulted from the progress of science there is afreshness about his work that is not to be found in any eminent previous philosopher since plato all the intermediate philosophers were teachers with the professional superioritybelonging to that avocation descartes writes not as a teacher but as a discoverer and exploreranxious to communicate what he has found his style is easy and unpedantic addressed tointelligent men of the world rather than to pupils it is moreover an extraordinarily excellentstyle it is very fortunate for modern philosophy that the pioneer had such admirable literarysense his successors both on the continent and in england until kant retain hisunprofessional character and several of them retain something of his stylistic merit descartess father was a councillor of the parlement of brittany and possessed a moderateamount of landed property when descartes inherited at his fathers death he sold his estatesand invested the money obtaining an income of six or seven thousand francs a year he waseducated from to at the jesuit college of la flche which seems to have givenhim a much better grounding in modern mathematics than he could have got at mostuniversities at that time in he went to paris where he found social life boring and retiredto a secluded retreat in the faubourg saint germain in which he worked at geometry friendsnosed him out however so to secure more complete quiet he enlisted in the dutch army as holland was at peace at the time he seems to have enjoyed two years ofundisturbed meditation however the coming of the thirty years war led him to enlist in the bavarian army it was in bavaria during the winter that he had the experiencehe describes in the discours de la mthode the weather being cold he got into a stove inthe morning and stayed there all day meditating by his own account his philosophy was halffinished when he came out but this need not be accepted too literally socrates used to meditateall day in the snow but descartess mind only worked when he was warm in he gave up fighting after a visit to italy he settled in paris  descartes says it was a stove but most commentators think this impossible thosewho know oldfashioned bavarian houses however assure me that it is entirely credible

has been inferred from the fact that i think therefore i exist while i think and only then if iceased to think there would be no evidence of my existence i am a thing that thinks a substanceof which the whole nature or essence consists in thinking and which needs no place or materialthing for its existence the soul therefore is wholly distinct from the body and easier to knowthan the body it would be what it is even if there were no body descartes next asks himself why is the cogito so evident he concludes that it is only because itis clear and distinct he therefore adopts as a general rule the principle all things that weconceive very clearly and very distinctly are true he admits however that there is sometimesdifficulty in knowing which these things are thinking is used by descartes in a very wide sense a thing that thinks he says is one thatdoubts understands conceives affirms denies wills imagines and feelsfor feeling as it occursin dreams is a form of thinking since thought is the essence of mind the mind must alwaysthink even during deep sleep descartes now resumes the question of our knowledge of bodies he takes as an example a pieceof wax from the honeycomb certain things are apparent to the senses it tastes of honey it smellsof flowers it has a certain sensible colour size and shape it is hard and cold and if struck it emitsa sound but if you put it near the fire these qualities change although the wax persists thereforewhat appeared to the senses was not the wax itself the wax itself is constituted by extensionflexibility and motion which are understood by the mind not by the imagination the thing thatis the wax cannot itself be sensible since it is equally involved in all the appearances of the waxto the various senses the perception of the wax is not a vision or touch or imagination but aninspection of the mind i do not see the wax any more than i see men in the street when i see hatsand coats i understand by the sole power of judgement which resides in my mind what ithought i saw with my eyes knowledge by the senses is confused and shared with animals butnow i have stripped the wax of its clothes and mentally perceive it naked from my sensiblyseeing the wax my own existence follows with certainty but not that of the wax knowledge ofexternal things must be by the mind not by the senses this leads to a consideration of different kinds of ideas the commonest of errors descartes saysis to think that my ideas are like out side things ideas seem to beof three sorts those that are innate those that are foreign and come from without thosethat are invented by me the second kind of ideas we naturally suppose are like outside objects we suppose this partly because nature teaches us to think so partly because such ideas comeindependently of the will and it therefore seems reasonable to supposethat a foreign thing imprints its likeness on me but are these good reasons when i speak ofbeing taught by nature in this connection i only mean that i have a certain inclination to believeit not that i see it by a natural light what is seen by a natural light cannot be denied but a mereinclination may be towards what is false and as for ideas of sense being involuntary that is noargument for dreams are involuntary although they come from within the reasons for supposingthat ideas of sense come from without are therefore inconclusive moreover there are sometimes two different ideas of the same external object eg the sun as itappears to the senses and the sun in which the astronomers believe these cannot both be like thesun and reason shows that the one which comes directly from experience must be the less like itof the two but these considerations have not disposed of the sceptical arguments which threw doubt on theexistence of the external world this can only be done by first proving the existence of god descartess proofs of the existence of god are not very original in the main they come fromscholastic philosophy they were better stated by leibniz and i will omit consideration of themuntil we come to him when gods existence has been proved the rest proceeds easily since god is good he will notact like the deceitful demon whom descartes has imagined as a ground for doubt now god hasgiven me such a strong inclination to believe in bodies that he would be deceitful if there werenone therefore bodies exist he must moreover have given me the faculty of correcting errors iuse this faculty when i employ the principle that what is clear and distinct is true this enables meto know mathematics and physics also if i remember that i must know the truth about bodies bythe mind alone not by mind and body jointly the constructive part of descartess theory of knowledge is much 
side things ideas seem to beof three sorts those that are innate those that are foreign and come from without thosethat are invented by me the second kind of ideas we naturally suppose are like outside objects we suppose this partly because nature teaches us to think so partly because such ideas comeindependently of the will and it therefore seems reasonable to supposethat a foreign thing imprints its likeness on me but are these good reasons when i speak ofbeing taught by nature in this connection i only mean that i have a certain inclination to believeit not that i see it by a natural light what is seen by a natural light cannot be denied but a mereinclination may be towards what is false and as for ideas of sense being involuntary that is noargument for dreams are involuntary although they come from within the reasons for supposingthat ideas of sense come from without are therefore inconclusive moreover there are sometimes two different ideas of the same external object eg the sun as itappears to the senses and the sun in which the astronomers believe these cannot both be like thesun and reason shows that the one which comes directly from experience must be the less like itof the two but these considerations have not disposed of the sceptical arguments which threw doubt on theexistence of the external world this can only be done by first proving the existence of god descartess proofs of the existence of god are not very original in the main they come fromscholastic philosophy they were better stated by leibniz and i will omit consideration of themuntil we come to him when gods existence has been proved the rest proceeds easily since god is good he will notact like the deceitful demon whom descartes has imagined as a ground for doubt now god hasgiven me such a strong inclination to believe in bodies that he would be deceitful if there werenone therefore bodies exist he must moreover have given me the faculty of correcting errors iuse this faculty when i employ the principle that what is clear and distinct is true this enables meto know mathematics and physics also if i remember that i must know the truth about bodies bythe mind alone not by mind and body jointly the constructive part of descartess theory of knowledge is much less interesting than the earlier destructive part it uses all sorts of scholastic maxims such as thatan effect can never have more perfection than its cause which have somehow escaped the initialcritical scrutiny no reason is given for accepting these maxims although they are certainly lessselfevident than ones own existence which is proved with a flourish of trumpets platos theaetetus saint augustine and saint thomas contain most of what is affirmative in the meditations the method of critical doubt though descartes himself applied it only halfheartedly was of greatphilosophic importance it is clear as a matter of logic that it can only yield positive results ifscepticism is to stop somewhere if there is to be both logical and empirical knowledge theremust be two kinds of stopping points indubitable facts and indubitable principles of inference descartess indubitable facts are his own thoughtsusing thought in the widest possible sense ithink is his ultimate premiss here the word i is really illegitimate he ought to state hisultimate premiss in the form there are thoughts the word i is grammatically convenient butdoes not describe a datum when he goes on to say i am a thing which thinks he is alreadyusing uncritically the apparatus of categories handed down by scholasticism he nowhere provesthat thoughts need a thinker nor is there reason to believe this except in a grammatical sense thedecision however to regard thoughts rather than external objects as the prime empiricalcertainties was very important and had a profound effect on all subsequent philosophy in two other respects the philosophy of descartes was important first it brought to completionor very nearly to completion the dualism of mind and matter which began with plato and wasdeveloped largely for religious reasons by christian philosophy ignoring the curious transactionsin the pineal gland which were dropped by the followers of descartes the cartesian systempresents two parallel but independent worlds that of mind and that of matter each of which canbe studied without reference to the other that the mind does not move the body was a new ideadue explicitly to geulincx but implicitly to descartes it had the advantage of making it possibleto say that the body does not move the mind there is a considerable discussion in the meditationsas to why the mind feels sorrow when the body is thirsty the correct cartesian answer was thatthe body and the mind were like two clocks and that when one indicated thirst the other 
less interesting than the earlier destructive part it uses all sorts of scholastic maxims such as thatan effect can never have more perfection than its cause which have somehow escaped the initialcritical scrutiny no reason is given for accepting these maxims although they are certainly lessselfevident than ones own existence which is proved with a flourish of trumpets platos theaetetus saint augustine and saint thomas contain most of what is affirmative in the meditations the method of critical doubt though descartes himself applied it only halfheartedly was of greatphilosophic importance it is clear as a matter of logic that it can only yield positive results ifscepticism is to stop somewhere if there is to be both logical and empirical knowledge theremust be two kinds of

philosophy in two other respects the philosophy of descartes was important first it brought to completionor very nearly to completion the dualism of mind and matter which began with plato and wasdeveloped largely for religious reasons by christian philosophy ignoring the curious transactionsin the pineal gland which were dropped by the followers of descartes the cartesian systempresents two parallel but independent worlds that of mind and that of matter each of which canbe studied without reference to the other that the mind does not move the body was a new ideadue explicitly to geulincx but implicitly to descartes it had the advantage of making it possibleto say that the body does not move the mind there is a considerable discussion in the meditationsas to why the mind feels sorrow when the body is thirsty the correct cartesian answer was thatthe body and the mind were like two clocks and that when one indicated thirst the other indicated sorrow from the religious point of view however there was a grave drawback to thistheory and this brings me to the second characteristic of cartesianism that i alluded to above in the whole theory of the material world cartesianism was rigidly deterministic livingorganisms just as much as dead matter were governed by the laws of physics there was nolonger need as in the aristotelian philosophy of an entelechy or soul to explain the growth oforganisms and the movements of animals descartes himself allowed one small exception ahuman soul could by volition alter the direction though not the quantity of the motion of theanimal spirits this however was contrary to the spirit of the system and turned out to becontrary to the laws of mechanics it was therefore dropped the consequence was that all themovements of matter were determined by physical laws and owing to parallelism mental eventsmust be equally determinate consequently cartesians had difficulty about free will and for thosewho paid more attention to descartess science than to his theory of knowledge it was not difficultto extend the theory that animals are automata why not say the same of man and simplify thesystem by making it a consistent materialism this step was actually taken in the eighteenthcentury there is in descartes an unresolved dualism between what he learnt from contemporary scienceand the scholasticism that he had been taught at la flche

the tractatus theologico politicus and the tractatus politicus the former is a curiouscombination of biblical criticism and political theory the latter deals with political theory only inbiblical criticism spinoza partially anticipates modern views particularly in assigning much laterdates to various books of the old testament than those assigned by tradition he endeavoursthroughout to show that the scriptures can be interpreted so as to be compatible with a liberaltheology spinozas political theory is in the main derived from hobbes in spite of the enormoustemperamental difference between the two men he holds that in a state of nature there is no rightor wrong for wrong consists in disobeying the law he holds that the sovereign can do no wrongand agrees with hobbes that the church should be entirely subordinate to the state he is opposedto all rebellion even against a bad government and instances the troubles in england as a proof ofthe harm that comes of forcible resistance to authority but he disagrees with hobbes in thinkingdemocracy the most natural form of government he disagrees also in holding that subjectsshould not sacrifice all their rights to the sovereign in particular he holds freedom of opinionimportant i do not quite know how he reconciles this with the opinion that religious questionsshould be decided by the state i think when he says this he means that they should be decided bythe state rather than the church in holland the state was much more tolerant than the church spinoza ethics deals with three distinct matters it begins with metaphysics it then goes on to thepsychology of the passions and the will and finally it sets forth an ethic based on the precedingmetaphysics and psychology the metaphysic is a modification of descartes the psychology isreminiscent of hobbes but the ethic is original and is what is of most value in the book therelation of spinoza to descartes is in some ways not unlike the relation of plotinus to plato descartes was a manysided man full of intellectual curiosity but not much burdened with moralearnestness although he invented proofs intended to support orthodox beliefs he could havebeen used by sceptics as carneades used plato spinoza although he was not without scientificinterests and even wrote a treatise on the rainbow was in the main concerned with religion andvirtue he

the understanding he has grasped the sole reality of the whole he is free the implications of thisdoctrine are developed in the last book of the ethics spinoza does not like the stoics object to all emotions he objects only to those that arepassions ie those in which we appear to ourselves to be passive in the power of outside forcesan emotion which is a passion ceases to be a passion as soon as we form a clear and distinct ideaof it understanding that all things are necessary helps the mind to acquire power over theemotions he who clearly and distinctly understands himself and his emotions loves god and somuch the more as he more understands himself and his emotions this proposition introduces usto the intellectual love of god in which wisdom consists the intellectual love of god is aunion of thought and emotion it consists i think one may say in true thought combined with joyin the apprehension of truth all joy in true thought is part of the intellectual love of god for itcontains nothing negative and is therefore truly part of the whole not only apparently as arefragmentary things so separated in thought as to appear bad i said a moment ago that the intellectual love of god involves joy but perhaps this was a mistakefor spinoza says that god is not affected by any emotion of pleasure or pain and also says thatthe intellectual love of the mind towards god is part of the infinite love wherewith god loveshimself i think nevertheless that there is something in intellectual love which is not mereintellect perhaps the joy involved is considered as something superior to pleasure love towards god we are told must hold the chief place in the mind i have omitted spinozas demonstrations but in so doing i have given an incomplete picture of his thought asthe proof of the above proposition is short i will quote it in full the reader can then inimagination supply proofs to other propositions the proof of the above proposition is as follows for this love is associated with all the modifications of the body and is fostered by themall therefore it must hold the chief place in the mind qed of the propositions referred to in the above proof v states the mind can bring it about thatall bodily modifications or images of things may be referred to the idea of god v quotedabove states he who clearly and distinctly understands himself and his emotions loves god and so much the more in proportion as he understands himself and hisemotions v states in proportion as a mental image is referred to more objects so is it morefrequent or more often vivid and occupies the mind more the proof quoted above might be expressed as follows every increase in the understanding ofwhat happens to us consists in referring events to the idea of god since in truth everything ispart of god this understanding of everything as part of god is love of god when all objects arereferred to god the idea of god will fully occupy the mind thus the statement that love of god must hold the chief place in the mind is not a primarilymoral exhortation but an account of what must inevitably happen as we acquire understanding we are told that no one can hate god but on the other hand he who loves god cannotendeavour that god should love him in return goethe who admired spinoza without evenbeginning to understand him thought this proposition an instance of selfabnegation it is nothingof the sort but a logical consequence of spinozas metaphysic he does not say that a man oughtnot to want god to love him he says that a man who loves god cannot want god to love him this is made plain by the proof which says for if a man shall so endeavour he would desire v corol that god whom he loves should not be god and consequently he would desire tofeel pain which is absurd v is the proposition already referred to whichsays that god has no passions or pleasures or pains the corollary referred to above deduces that god loves and hates no one here again what is involved is not an ethical precept but a logicalnecessity a man who loved god and wished god to love him would be wishing to feel painwhich is absurd the statement that god can love no one should not be considered to contradict the statement that god loves himself with an infinite intellectual love he may love himself since that is possiblewithout false belief and in any case intellectual love is a very special kind of love at this point spinoza tells us that he has now given us all the remedies against the emotionsthe great remedy is clear and distinct ideas as to the nature of the emotions and their relation toexternal causes there is a further advantage in love of god as compared to love of 
emotions loves god and so much the more in proportion as he understands himself and hisemotions v states in proportion as a mental image is referred to more objects so is it morefrequent or more often vivid and occupies the mind more the proof quoted above might be expressed as follows every increase in the understanding ofwhat happens to us consists in referring events to the idea of god since in truth everything ispart of god this understanding of everything as part of god is love of god when all objects arereferred to god the idea of god will fully occupy the mind thus the statement that love of god must hold the chief place in the mind is not a primarilymoral exhortation but an account of what must inevitably happen as we acquire understanding we are told that no one can hate god but on the other hand he who loves god cannotendeavour that god should love him in return goethe who admired spinoza without evenbeginning to understand him thought this proposition an instance of selfabnegation it is nothingof the sort but a logical consequence of spinozas metaphysic he does not say that a man oughtnot to want god to love him he says that a man who loves god cannot want god to love him this is made plain by the proof which says for if a man shall so endeavour he would desire v corol that god whom he loves should not be god and consequently he would desire tofeel pain which is absurd v is the proposition already referred to whichsays that god has no passions or pleasures or pains the corollary referred to above deduces that god loves and hates no one here again what is involved is not an ethical precept but a logicalnecessity a man who loved god and wished god to love him would be wishing to feel painwhich is absurd the statement that god can love no one should not be considered to contradict the statement that god loves himself with an infinite intellectual love he may love himself since that is possiblewithout false belief and in any case intellectual love is a very special kind of love at this point spinoza tells us that he has now given us all the remedies against the emotionsthe great remedy is clear and distinct ideas as to the nature of the emotions and their relation toexternal causes there is a further advantage in love of god as compared to love of human beings spiritual unhealthiness and misfortunes can generally be traced to excessive loveof something which is subject to many variations but clear and distinct knowledge begets alove towards a thing immutable and eternal and such love has not the turbulent and disquietingcharacter of love for an object which is transient and changeable although personal survival after death is an illusion there is nevertheless something in the humanmind that is eternal the mind can only imagine or remember while the body endures but there isin god an idea which expresses the essence of this or that human body under the form of eternityand this idea is the eternal part of the mind the intellectual love of god when experienced by anindividual is contained in this eternal part of the mind blessedness which consists of love towards god is not the reward of virtue but virtue itself wedo not rejoice in it because we control our lusts but we control our lusts because we rejoice in it the ethics ends with these words the wise man in so far as he is regarded as such is scarcely at all disturbed in spirit but beingconscious of himself and of god and of things by a certain eternal necessity never ceases to bebut always possesses true acquiescence of his spirit if the way which i have pointed out as leadingto this result seems exceedingly hard it may nevertheless be discovered needs must it be hardsince it is so seldom found how would it be possible if salvation were ready to our hand andcould without great labour be found that it should be by almost all men neglected but allexcellent things are as difficult as they are rare in forming a critical estimate of spinozas importance as a philosopher it is necessary todistinguish his ethics from his metaphysics and to consider how much of the former can survivethe rejection of the latter spinozas metaphysic is the best example of what may be called logical monismthe doctrinenamely that the world as a whole is a single substance none of whose parts are logically capableof existing alone the ultimate basis for this view is the belief that every proposition has a singlesubject and a single predicate which leads us to the conclusion that relations and plurality must beillusory spinoza thought that the nature of the world and of human life could be logi

but the sufficient reason of his action has no logical necessity so at least leibniz says when he iswriting popularly but as we shall see he had another doctrine which he kept to himself afterfinding that arnauld thought it shocking gods actions have the same kind of freedom he always acts for the best but he is not under anylogical compulsion to do so leibniz agrees with thomas aquinas that god cannot act contrary tothe laws of logic but he can decree whatever is logically possible and this leaves him a greatlatitude of choice leibniz brought into their final form the metaphysical proofs of gods existence these had a longhistory they begin with aristotle or even with plato they were formalized by the scholastics andone of them the ontological argument was invented by saint anselm this argument thoughrejected by saint thomas was revived by descartes leibniz whose logical skill was supremestated the arguments better than they had ever been stated before that is my reason for examiningthem in connection with him before examining the arguments in detail it is as well to realize that modern theologians nolonger rely upon them medieval theology is derivative from the greek intellect the god of the old testament is a god of power the god of the new testament is also a god of love but the god of the theologians from aristotle to calvin is one whose appeal is intellectual his existencesolves certain puzzles which otherwise would create argumentative difficulties in theunderstanding of the universe this deity who appears at the end of a piece of reasoning like theproof of a proposition in geometry did not satisfy rousseau who reverted to a conception of godmore akin to that of the gospels in the main modern theologians especially such as are protestant have followed rousseau in this respect the philosophers have been moreconservative in hegel lotze and bradley arguments of the metaphysical sort persist in spite ofthe fact that kant professed to have demolished such arguments once for all leibnizs arguments for the existence of god are four in number they are the ontologicalargument the cosmological argument the argument from the eternal truths theargument from the preestablished harmony which may be generalized into the argument fromdesign or the physicotheological argument as kant calls it we will consider these argumentssuccessively the ontological argument depends upon the distinction between existence and essence anyordinary person or thing it is held on the one hand exists and on the other hand has certainqualities which make up his or its essence hamlet though he does not exist has a certainessence he is melancholy undecided witty etc when we describe a person the question whetherhe is real or imaginary remains open however minute our description may be this is expressed inscholastic language by saying that in the case of any finite substance its essence does not implyits existence but in the case of god defined as the most perfect being saint anselm followedby descartes maintains that essence does imply existence on the ground that a being whopossesses all other perfections is better if he exists than if he does not from which it follows thatif he does not he is not the best possible being leibniz neither wholly accepts nor wholly rejects this argument it needs to be supplemented sohe says by a proof that god so defined is possible he wrote out a proof that the idea of god ispossible which he showed to spinoza when he saw him at the hague this proof defines god asthe most perfect being ie as the subject of all perfections and a perfection is defined as asimple quality which is positive and absolute and expresses without any limits whatever it doesexpress leibniz easily proves that no two perfections as above defined can be incompatible heconcludes there is therefore or there can be conceived a subject of all perfections or mostperfect being whence it follows also that he exists for existence is among the number of theperfections kant countered this argument by maintaining that existence is not a predicate another kind ofrefutation results from my theory of descriptions the argument does not to a modern mind seemvery convincing but it is easier to feel convinced that it must be fallacious than it is to find outprecisely where the fallacy lies the cosmological argument is more plausible than the ontological argument it is a form of the first cause argument which is itself derived from aristotles argument of the unmoved mover the first cause argument is simple it points out that everything finite has a cause which in turnhad a cause and so on this series of previous causes cannot it is maintained be infinite and thefirst term in the series must itself be uncaused since otherwise it would not be the first 
the ontological argument depends upon the distinction between existence and essence anyordinary person or thing it is held on the one hand exists and on the other hand has certainqualities which make up his or its essence hamlet though he does not exist has a certainessence he is melancholy undecided witty etc when we describe a person the question whetherhe is real or imaginary remains open however minute our description may be this is expressed inscholastic language by saying that in the case of any finite substance its essence does not implyits existence but in the case of god defined as the most perfect being saint anselm followedby descartes maintains that essence does imply existence on the ground that a being whopossesses all other perfections is better if he exists than if he does not from which it follows thatif he does not he is not the best possible being leibniz neither wholly accepts nor wholly rejects this argument it needs to be supplemented sohe says by a proof that god so defined is possible he wrote out a proof that the idea of god ispossible which he showed to spinoza when he saw him at the hague this proof defines god asthe most perfect being ie as the subject of all perfections and a perfection is defined as asimple quality which is positive and absolute and expresses without any limits whatever it doesexpress leibniz easily proves that no two perfections as above defined can be incompatible heconcludes there is therefore or there can be conceived a subject of all perfections or mostperfect being whence it follows also that he exists for existence is among the number of theperfections kant countered this argument by maintaining that existence is not a predicate another kind ofrefutation results from my theory of descriptions the argument does not to a modern mind seemvery convincing but it is easier to feel convinced that it must be fallacious than it is to find outprecisely where the fallacy lies the cosmological argument is more plausible than the ontological argument it is a form of the first cause argument which is itself derived from aristotles argument of the unmoved mover the first cause argument is simple it points out that everything finite has a cause which in turnhad a cause and so on this series of previous causes cannot it is maintained be infinite and thefirst term in the series must itself be uncaused since otherwise it would not be the first term there is therefore an uncaused cause of everything and this is obviously god in leibniz the argument takes a somewhat different form he argues that every particular thing inthe world is contingent that is to say it would be logically possible for it not to exist and this istrue not only of each particular thing but of the whole universe even if we suppose the universeto have always existed there is nothing within the universe to show why it exists but everythinghas to have a sufficient reason according to leibnizs philosophy therefore the universe as awhole must have a sufficient reason which must be outside the universe this sufficient reason is god this argument is better than the straightforward first cause argument and cannot be so easilyrefuted the first cause argument rests on the assumption that every series must have a first termwhich is false for example the series of proper fractions has no first term but leibnizs argumentdoes not depend upon the view that the universe must have had a beginning in time the argumentis valid so long as we grant leibnizs principle of sufficient reason but if this principle is denied itcollapses what exactly leibniz meant by the principle of sufficient reason is a controversialquestion couturat maintains that it means that every true proposition is analytic ie such thatits contradictory is selfcontradictory but this interpretation belongs if true to the esoteric doctrine in his published works hemaintains that there is a difference between necessary and contingent propositions that only theformer follow from the laws of logic and that all propositions asserting existence are contingentwith the sole exception of the existence of god though god exists necessarily he was notcompelled by logic to create the world on the contrary this was a free choice motivated but notnecessitated by his goodness it is clear that kant is right in saying that this argument depends upon the ontological argument ifthe existence of the world can only be accounted for by the existence of a necessary being thenthere must be a being whose essence involves existence for that is what is meant by a necessary being but if it is possible that there should be a being whose essence involves existence thenreason alone without experience can define such a being whose existence will follow from theontological argument for everything that has to do only with 
term there is therefore an uncaused cause of everything and this is obviously god in leibniz the argument takes a somewhat different form he argues that every particular thing inthe world is contingent that is to say it would be logically possible for it not to exist and this istrue not only of each particular thing but of the whole universe even if we suppose the universeto have always existed there is nothing within the universe to show why it exists but everythinghas to have a sufficient reason according to leibnizs philosophy therefore the universe as awhole must have a sufficient reason which must be outside the universe this sufficient reason is god this argument is better than the straightforward first cause argument and cannot be so easilyrefuted the first cause argument rests on the assumption that every series must have a first termwhich is false for example the series of proper fractions has no first term but leibnizs argumentdoes not depend upon the view that the universe must have had a beginning in time the argumentis valid so long as we grant leibnizs principle of sufficient reason but if this principle is denied itcollapses what exactly leibniz meant by the principle of sufficient reason is a controversialquestion couturat maintains that it means that every true proposition is analytic ie such thatits contradictory is selfcontradictory but this interpretation belongs if true to the esoteric doctrine in his published works hemaintains that there is a difference between necessary and contingent propositions that only theformer follow from the laws of logic and that all propositions asserting existence are contingentwith the sole exception of the existence of god though god exists necessarily he was notcompelled by logic to create the world on the contrary this was a free choice motivated but notnecessitated by his goodness it is clear that kant is right in saying that this argument depends upon the ontological argument ifthe existence of the world can only be accounted for by the existence of a necessary being thenthere must be a being whose essence involves existence for that is what is meant by a necessary being but if it is possible that there should be a being whose essence involves existence thenreason alone without experience can define such a being whose existence will follow from theontological argument for everything that has to do only with essence can be known independently of experiencesuch at least is leibnizs view the apparentgreater plausibility of the cosmological as opposed to the ontological argument is thereforedeceptive the argument from the eternal truths is a little difficult to state precisely perhaps we shall do wellto state it first in rough outline and only then proceed to the complete picture roughly theargument is this such a statement as it is raining is sometimes true and sometimes false buttwo and two are four is always true all statements that have only to do with essence not withexistence are either always true or never true those that are always true are called eternaltruths the gist of the argument is that truths are part of the contents of minds and that an eternaltruth must be part of the content of an eternal mind there is already an argument not unlike thisin plato where he deduces immortality from the eternity of the ideas but in leibniz the argumentis more developed he holds that the ultimate reason for contingent truths must be found innecessary truths the argument here is as in the cosmological argument there must be a reason forthe whole contingent world and this reason cannot itself be contingent but must be sought amongeternal truths but a reason for what exists must itself exist therefore eternal truths must in somesense exist and they can only exist as thoughts in the mind of god this argument is really onlyanother form of the cosmological argument it is however open to the further objection that atruth can hardly be said to exist in a mind which apprehends it the argument from the preestablished harmony as leibniz states it is only valid for those whoaccept his windowless monads which all mirror the universe the argument is that since all theclocks keep time with each other without any causal interaction there must have been a singleoutside cause that regulated all of them the difficulty of course is the one that besets the wholemonadology if the monads never interact how does any one of them know that there are anyothers what seems like mirroring the universe may be merely a dream in fact if leibniz is rightit is merely a dream but he has ascertained somehow that all the monads have similar dreams atthe same time this of course is fantastic and would never have seemed credible but for theprevious history of cartesianism leibnizs argument however can be freed from dependence on his peculiar metaphysic andtransformed into what is called the argu 
essence can be known independently of experiencesuch at least is leibnizs view the apparentgreater plausibility of the cosmological as opposed to the ontological argument is thereforedeceptive the argument from the eternal truths is a little difficult to state precisely perhaps we shall do wellto state it first in rough outline and only then proceed to the complete picture roughly theargument is this such a statement as it is raining is sometimes true and sometimes false buttwo and two are four is always true all statements that have only to do with essence not withexistence are either always true or never true those that are always true are called eternaltruths the gist of the argument is that truths are part of the contents of minds and that an eternaltruth must be part of the content of an eternal mind there is already an argument not unlike thisin plato where he deduces immortality from the eternity of the ideas but in leibniz the argumentis more developed he holds that the ultimate reason for contingent truths must be found innecessary truths the argument here is as in the cosmological argument there must be a reason forthe whole contingent world and this reason cannot itself be contingent but must be sought amongeternal truths but a reason for what exists must itself exist therefore eternal truths must in somesense exist and they can only exist as thoughts in the mind of god this argument is really onlyanother form of the cosmological argument it is however open to the further objection that atruth can hardly be said to exist in a mind which apprehends it the argument from the preestablished harmony as leibniz states it is only valid for those whoaccept his windowless monads which all mirror the universe the argument is that since all theclocks keep time with each other without any causal interaction there must have been a singleoutside cause that regulated all of them the difficulty of course is the one that besets the wholemonadology if the monads never interact how does any one of them know that there are anyothers what seems like mirroring the universe may be merely a dream in fact if leibniz is rightit is merely a dream but he has ascertained somehow that all the monads have similar dreams atthe same time this of course is fantastic and would never have seemed credible but for theprevious history of cartesianism leibnizs argument however can be freed from dependence on his peculiar metaphysic andtransformed into what is called the argu ment from design this argument contends that on a survey of the known world we find thingswhich cannot plausibly be explained as the product of blind natural forces but are much morereasonably to be regarded as evidences of a beneficent purpose this argument has no formal logical defect its premisses are empirical and its conclusionprofesses to be reached in accordance with the usual canons of empirical inference the questionwhether it is to be accepted or not turns therefore not on general metaphysical questions but oncomparatively detailed considerations there is one important difference between this argumentand the others namely that the god whom it demonstrates need not have all the usualmetaphysical attributes he need not be omnipotent or omniscient he may be only vastly wiserand more powerful than we are the evils in the world may be due to his limited power somemodern theologians have made use of these possibilities in forming their conception of god butsuch speculations are remote from the philosophy of leibniz to which we must now return one of the most characteristic features of that philosophy is the doctrine of many possible worlds a world is possible if it does not contradict the laws of logic there are an infinite number ofpossible worlds all of which god contemplated before creating the actual world being good goddecided to create the best of the possible worlds and he considered that one to be the best whichhad the greatest excess of good over evil he could have created a world containing no evil but itwould not have been so good as the actual world that is because some great goods are logicallybound up with certain evils to take a trivial illustration a drink of cold water when you are verythirsty on a hot day may give you such great pleasure that you think the previous thirst thoughpainful was worth enduring because without it the subsequent enjoyment could not have been sogreat for theology it is not such illustrations that are important but the connection of sin withfree will free will is a great good but it was logically impossible for god to bestow free will andat the same time decree that there should be no sin god therefore decided to make man freealthough he foresaw that adam would eat the apple and although sin inevitably broughtpunishment the world that resulted although it contains evil has a greater surplus of good overevil than any other possible world it is therefore the best of all

chapter v parmenides the greeks were not addicted to moderation either in their theories or in their practice heraclitus maintained that everything changes parmenides retorted that nothing changes parmenides was a native of elea in the south of italy and flourished in the first half of the fifthcentury bc according to plato socrates in his youth had aninterview with parmenides then an old man and learnt much from him whether or not thisinterview is historical we may at least infer what is otherwise evident that plato himself wasinfluenced by the doctrines of parmenides the south italian and sicilian philosophers were moreinclined to mysticism and religion than those of ionia who were on the whole scientific andsceptical in their tendencies but mathematics under the influence of pythagoras flourished morein magna grecia than in ionia mathematics at that time however was entangled with mysticism parmenides was influenced by pythagoras but the extent of this influence is conjectural whatmakes parmenides historically important is that he invented a form of metaphysical argument thatin one form or another is to be found in most subsequent metaphysicians down to and including hegel he is often said to have invented logic but what he really invented was metaphysics basedon logic the doctrine of parmenides was set forth in a poem on nature he considered the sensesdeceptive and condemned the multitude of sensible things as mere illusion the only true being isthe one which is infinite and indivisible it is not as in heraclitus a union of opposites sincethere are no opposites he apparently thought for instance that cold means only not hot anddark means only not light the one is not conceived by parmenides as we conceive god heseems to think of it as material and extended for he speaks of it as a sphere but it cannot be divided because the whole of it is present everywhere parmenides divides his teaching into two parts called respectively the way of truth and theway of opinion we need not concern ourselves with the latter what he says about the way oftruth so far as it has survived is in its essential points as follows thou canst not know what is notthat is impossiblenor utter it for it is the same thing thatcan be thought and that can be how then can what is be going to be in the future or how could it come into being if itcame into being it is not nor is it if it is going to be in the future thus is becomingextinguished and passing away not to be heard of the thing that can be thought and that for the sake of which the thought exists is the same foryou cannot find thought without something that is as to which it is uttered the essence of this argument is when you think you think of something when you use aname it must be the name of something therefore both thought and language require objectsoutside themselves and since you can think of a thing or speak of it at one time as well as atanother whatever can be thought of or spoken of must exist at all times consequently there canbe no change since change consists in things coming into being or ceasing to be this is the first example in philosophy of an argument from thought and language to the worldat large it cannot of course be accepted as valid but it is worth while to see what element oftruth it contains we can put the argument in this way if language is not just nonsense words must meansomething and in general they must not mean just other words but something that is therewhether we talk of it or not suppose for example that you talk of george washington unlessthere were a historical person who had that name the name would bemeaningless and sentences containing the name would be nonsense parmenides maintains thatnot only must george washington have existed in the past but in some sense he must still existsince we can still use his name significantly this seems obviously untrue but how are we toget round the argument  burnets note the meaning i think is this  there can be no thought corresponding toa name that is not the name of something real 
his letters to arnauld which contain a part of his more profound philosophy were published inthe nineteenth century but i was the first to notice their importance arnaulds reception of theseletters was discouraging he writes i find in these thoughts so many things which alarm me andwhich almost all men if i am not mistaken will find so shocking that i do not see of what use awriting can be which apparently all the world will reject this hostile opinion no doubt led leibniz thenceforth to adopt a policy of secrecy as to his real thoughts on philosophical subjects the conception of substance which is fundamental in the philosophies of descartes spinoza and leibniz is derived from the logical category of subject and predicate some words can be eithersubjects or predicates eg i can say the sky is blue and blue is a colour other wordsofwhich proper names are the most obvious instances can never occur as predicates but only assubjects or as one of the terms of a relation such words are held to designate substances substances in addition to this logical characteristic persist through time unless destroyed by gods omnipotence every true proposition is either generallike all men are mortal in which case it states that one predicate implies another or particularlike socrates is mortal in which case the predicate is contained in the subject and the qualitydenoted by the predicate is part of the notion of the substance denoted by the subject whateverhappens to socrates can be asserted in a sentence in which socrates is the subject and the wordsdescribing the happening in question are the predicate all these predicates put together make upthe notion of socrates all belong to him necessarily in this sense that a substance of whichthey could not be truly asserted would not be socrates but some one else leibniz was a firm believer in the importance of logic not only in its own sphere but as the basisof metaphysics he did work on mathematical logic which would have been enormously importantif he had published it he would in that case have been the founder of mathematical logic whichwould have become known a century and a half sooner than it did in fact he abstained frompublishing because he kept on finding evidence that aristotles doctrine of the syllogism waswrong on some points respect for aristotle made it impossible for him to believe this so hemistakenly supposed that the errors must be his own nevertheless he cherished through his life the hope of discovering a kind ofgeneralized mathematics which he called characteristica universalis by means of whichthinking could be replaced by calculation if we had it he says we should be able to reason inmetaphysics and morals in much the same way as in geometry and analysis if controversieswere to arise there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than betweentwo accountants for it would suffice to take their pencils in their hands to sit down to theirslates and to say to each other let us calculate leibniz based his philosophy upon two logical premisses the law of contradiction and the law ofsufficient reason both depend upon the notion of an analytic proposition which is one in whichthe predicate is contained in the subjectfor instance all white men are men the law ofcontradiction states that all analytic propositions are true the law of sufficient reason states that all true propositions are analytic this applies even to what weshould regard as empirical statements about matters of fact if i make a journey the notion of memust from all eternity have included the notion of this journey which is a predicate of me wemay say that the nature of an individual substance or complete being is to have a notion socompleted that it suffices to comprehend and to render deducible from it all the predicates of thesubject to which this notion is attributed thus the quality of king which belongs to alexander the great abstracting from the subject is not sufficiently determined for an individual and does notinvolve other qualities of the same subject nor all that the notion of this prince contains whereas god seeing the individual notion or hecceity of alexander sees in it at the same time thefoundation and the reason of all the predicates which can be truly attributed to him as egwhether he would conquer darius and porus even to knowing a priori whether he died a natural death or by poison which we can only know by history one of the most definite statements of the basis of his metaphysic occurs in a letter to arnauld in consulting the notion which i have of every true proposition i find that every predicatenecessary or contingent past present or future is comprised in the notion of the subject and iask no more

  the proposition in question is of great importance and deserves to be well established for itfollows that every soul is as a world apart independent of everything else except god that it isnot only immortal and so to speak impassible but that it keeps in its substance traces of all thathappens to it he goes on to explain that substances do not act on each other but agree through all mirroring theuniverse each from its own point of view there can be no interaction because all that happens toeach substance is part of its own notion and eternally determined if that substance exists this system is evidently just as deterministic as that of spinoza arnauld expresses his horror ofthe statement that the individual notion of each person involves oncefor all everything that will ever happen to him such a view is evidently incompatible with the christian doctrine of sin and free will finding it ill received by arnauld leibniz carefullyrefrained from making it public for human beings it is true there is a difference between truths known by logic and truths knownby experience this difference arises in two ways in the first place although everything thathappens to adam follows from his notion if he exists we can only ascertain his existence byexperience in the second place the notion of any individual substance is infinitely complex andthe analysis required to deduce his predicates is only possible for god these differenceshowever are only due to our ignorance and intellectual limitation for god they do not exist godapprehends the notion of adam in all its infinite complexity and can therefore see all truepropositions about adam as analytic god can also ascertain a priori whether adam exists for god knows his own goodness from which it follows that he will create the best possible worldand he also knows whether or not adam forms part of this world there is there fore no realescape from determinism through our ignorance there is however a further point which is very curious at most times leibniz represents the creation as a free act of god requiring the exercise of his will according to this doctrine thedetermination of what actually exists is not effected by observation but must proceed by way of gods goodness apart from gods goodness which leads him to create the best possible world there is no a priori reason why one thing should existrather than another but sometimes in papers not shown to any human being there is a quite different theory as towhy some things exist and others equally possible do not according to this view everything thatdoes not exist struggles to exist but not all possibles can exist because they are not allcompossible it may be possible that a should exist and also possible that b should exist butnot possible that both a and b should exist in that case a and b are not compossible two ormore things are only compossible when it is possible for all of them to exist leibniz seems tohave imagined a sort of war in the limbo inhabited by essences all trying to exist in this wargroups of compossibles combine and the largest group of compossibles wins like the largestpressure group in a political contest leibniz even uses this conception as a way of definingexistence he says the existent may be defined as that which is compatible with more thingsthan is anything incompatible with itself that is to say if a is incompatible with b while a iscompatible with c and d and e but b is only compatible with f and g then a but not b existsby definition the existent he says is the being which is compatible with the most things in this account there is no mention of god and apparently no act of creation nor is there need ofanything but pure logic for determining what exists the question whether a and b arecompossible is for leibniz a logical question namely does the existence of both a and binvolve a contradiction it follows that in theory logic can decide the question what group ofcompossibles is the largest and this group consequently will exist perhaps however leibniz did not really mean that the above was a definition of existence if itwas merely a criterion it can be reconciled with his popular views by means of what he callsmetaphysical perfection metaphysical perfection as he uses the term seems to mean quantityof existence it is he says nothing but the magnitude of positive reality strictly understood healways argues that god created as much as possible this is one of his reasons for rejecting avacuum there is a general belief that it is better to exist than notto exist on this ground children are exhorted to be grateful to their parents leibniz evidently heldthis 
leads him to create the best possible world there is no a priori reason why one thing should existrather than another but sometimes in papers not shown to any human being there is a quite different theory as towhy some things exist and others equally possible do not according to this view everything thatdoes not exist struggles to exist but not all possibles can exist because they are not allcompossible it may be possible that a should exist and also possible that b should exist butnot possible that both a and b should exist in that case a and b are not compossible two ormore things are only compossible when it is possible for all of them to exist leibniz seems tohave imagined a sort of war in the limbo inhabited by essences all trying to exist in this wargroups of compossibles combine and the largest group of compossibles wins like the largestpressure group in a political contest leibniz even uses this conception as a way of definingexistence he says the existent may be defined as that which is compatible with more thingsthan is anything incompatible with itself that is to say if a is incompatible with b while a iscompatible with c and d and e but b is only compatible with f and g then a but not b existsby definition the existent he says is the being which is compatible with the most things in this account there is no mention of god and apparently no act of creation nor is there need ofanything but pure logic for determining what exists the question whether a and b arecompossible is for leibniz a logical question namely does the existence of both a and binvolve a contradiction it follows that in theory logic can decide the question what group ofcompossibles is the largest and this group consequently will exist perhaps however leibniz did not really mean that the above was a definition of existence if itwas merely a criterion it can be reconciled with his popular views by means of what he callsmetaphysical perfection metaphysical perfection as he uses the term seems to mean quantityof existence it is he says nothing but the magnitude of positive reality strictly understood healways argues that god created as much as possible this is one of his reasons for rejecting avacuum there is a general belief that it is better to exist than notto exist on this ground children are exhorted to be grateful to their parents leibniz evidently heldthis view and thought it part of gods goodness to create as full a universe as possible it would followthat the actual world would consist of the largest group of compossibles it would still be true thatlogic alone given a sufficiently able logician could decide whether a given possible substancewould exist or not leibniz in his private thinking is the best example of a philosopher who uses logic as a key tometaphysics this type of philosophy begins with parmenides and is carried further in platos useof the theory of ideas to prove various extralogical propositions spinoza belongs to the sametype and so does hegel but none of these is so clear cut as leibniz in drawing inferences fromsyntax to the real world this kind of argumentation has fallen into disrepute owing to the growthof empiricism whether any valid inferences are possible from language to nonlinguistic facts is aquestion as to which i do not care to dogmatize but certainly the inferences found in leibniz andother a priori philosophers are not valid since all are due to a defective logic the subjectpredicate logic which all such philosophers in the past assumed either ignores relationsaltogether or produces fallacious arguments to prove that relations are unreal leibniz is guilty ofa special inconsistency in combining the subjectpredicate logic with pluralism for theproposition there are many monads is not of the subjectpredicate form to be consistent aphilosopher who believes all propositions to be of this form should be a monist like spinoza leibniz rejected monism largely owing to his interest in dynamics and to his argument thatextension involves repetition and therefore cannot be an attribute of a single substance leibniz is a dull writer and his effect on german philosophy was to make it pedantic and arid hisdisciple wolf who dominated the german universities until the publication of kant critique of pure reason left out whatever was most interesting in leibniz and produced a dry professorialway of thinking outside germany leibnizs philosophy had little influence his contemporary locke governed british philosophy while in france descartes continued to reign until he wasoverthrown by voltaire who made english empiricism fashionable nevertheless leibniz remains a great man and his greatness is more apparent now than it was atany earlier time apart from his eminence as a mathematician and as the inventor of theinfinitesimal calculus

speaks of it as a sphere but it cannot be divided because the whole of it is present everywhere parmenides divides his teaching into two parts called respectively the way of truth and theway of opinion we need not concern ourselves with the latter what he says about the way oftruth so far as it has survived is in its essential points as follows thou canst not know what is notthat is impossiblenor utter it for it is the same thing thatcan be thought and that can be how then can what is be going to be in the future or how could it come into being if itcame into being it is not nor is it if it is going to be in the future thus is becomingextinguished and passing away not to be heard of the thing that can be thought and that for the sake of which the thought exists is the same foryou cannot find thought without something that is as to which it is uttered the essence of this argument is when you think you think of something when you use aname it must be the name of something therefore both thought and language require objectsoutside themselves and since you can think of a thing or speak of it at one time as well as atanother whatever can be thought of or spoken of must exist at all times consequently there canbe no change since change consists in things coming into being or ceasing to be this is the first example in philosophy of an argument from thought and language to the worldat large it cannot of course be accepted as valid but it is worth while to see what element oftruth it contains we can put the argument in this way if language is not just nonsense words must meansomething and in general they must not mean just other words but something that is therewhether we talk of it or not suppose for example that you talk of george washington unlessthere were a historical person who had that name the name would bemeaningless and sentences containing the name would be nonsense parmenides maintains thatnot only must george washington have existed in the past but in some sense he must still existsince we can still use his name significantly this seems obviously untrue but how are we toget round the argument  burnets note the meaning i think is this  there can be no thought corresponding toa name that is not the name of something real let us take an imaginary person say hamlet consider the statement hamlet was prince of denmark in some sense this is true but not in the plain historical sense the true statement is shakespeare says that hamlet was prince of denmark or more explicitly shakespeare saysthere was a prince of denmark called hamlet here there is no longer anything imaginary shakespeare and denmark and the noise hamlet are all real but the noise hamlet is not reallya name since nobody is really called hamlet if you say hamlet is the name of an imaginaryperson that is not strictly correct you ought to say it is imagined that hamlet is the name of areal person hamlet is an imagined individual unicorns are an imagined species some sentences in which theword unicorn occurs are true and some are false but in each case not directly consider aunicorn has one horn and a cow has two horns to prove the latter you have to look at a cowit is not enough to say that in some book cows are said to have two horns but the evidence thatunicorns have one horn is only to be found in books and in fact the correct statement is certainbooks assert that there are animals with one horn called unicorns all statements about unicornsare really about the word unicorn just as all statements about hamlet are really about the word hamlet but it is obvious that in most cases we are not speaking of words but of what the words mean and this brings us back to the argument of parmenides that if a word can be used significantly itmust mean something not nothing and therefore what the word means must in some sense exist what then are we to say about george washington it seems we have only two alternatives oneis to say that he still exists the other is to say that when we use the words george washingtonwe are not really speaking of the man who bore that name either seems a paradox but the latter isless of a paradox and i shall try to show a sense in which it is true parmenides assumes that words have a constant meaning this is really the basis of his argumentwhich he supposes unquestionable but although the dictionary or the encyclopaedia gives whatmay be called the official and socially sanctioned meaning of a word no two

let us take an imaginary person say hamlet consider the statement hamlet was prince of denmark in some sense this is true but not in the plain historical sense the true statement is shakespeare says that hamlet was prince of denmark or more explicitly shakespeare saysthere was a prince of denmark called hamlet here there is no longer anything imaginary shakespeare and denmark and the noise hamlet are all real but the noise hamlet is not reallya name since nobody is really called hamlet if you say hamlet is the name of an imaginaryperson that is not strictly correct you ought to say it is imagined that hamlet is the name of areal person hamlet is an imagined individual unicorns are an imagined species some sentences in which theword unicorn occurs are true and some are false but in each case not directly consider aunicorn has one horn and a cow has two horns to prove the latter you have to look at a cowit is not enough to say that in some book cows are said to have two horns but the evidence thatunicorns have one horn is only to be found in books and in fact the correct statement is certainbooks assert that there are animals with one horn called unicorns all statements about unicornsare really about the word unicorn just as all statements about hamlet are really about the word hamlet but it is obvious that in most cases we are not speaking of words but of what the words mean and this brings us back to the argument of parmenides that if a word can be used significantly itmust mean something not nothing and therefore what the word means must in some sense exist what then are we to say about george washington it seems we have only two alternatives oneis to say that he still exists the other is to say that when we use the words george washingtonwe are not really speaking of the man who bore that name either seems a paradox but the latter isless of a paradox and i shall try to show a sense in which it is true parmenides assumes that words have a constant meaning this is really the basis of his argumentwhich he supposes unquestionable but although the dictionary or the encyclopaedia gives whatmay be called the official and socially sanctioned meaning of a word no two people who use the same word have just the same thought in their minds george washington himself could use his name and the word i as synonyms he could perceivehis own thoughts and the movements of his body and could therefore use his name with a fullermeaning than was possible for any one else his friends when in his presence could perceive themovements of his body and could divine his thoughts to them the name george washingtonstill denoted something concrete in their own experience after his death they had to substitutememories for perceptions which involved a change in the mental processes taking place whenthey used his name for us who never knew him the mental processes are again different wemay think of his picture and say to ourselves yes that man we may think the first president ofthe united states if we are very ignorant he may be to us merely the man who was called george washington whatever the name suggests to us it must be not the man himself since wenever knew him but something now present to sense or memory or thought this shows thefallacy of the argument of parmenides this perpetual change in the meanings of words is concealed by the fact that in general thechange makes no difference to the truth or falsehood of the propositions in which the words occur if you take any true sentence in which the name george washington occurs it will as a ruleremain true if you substitute the phrase the first president of the united states there areexceptions to this rule before washingtons election a man might say i hope george washington will be the first president of the united states but he would not say i hope the first president of the united states will be the first president of the united states unless he had anunusual passion for the law of identity but it is easy to make a rule for excluding theseexceptional cases and in those that remain you may substitute for george washington anydescriptive phrase that applies to him alone and it is only by means of such phrases that we knowwhat we know about him parmenides contends that since we can now know what is commonly regarded as past it cannotreally be past but must in some sense exist now hence he infers that there is no such thing aschange what we have been saying about george washington meets

people who use the same word have just the same thought in their minds george washington himself could use his name and the word i as synonyms he could perceivehis own thoughts and the movements of his body and could therefore use his name with a fullermeaning than was possible for any one else his friends when in his presence could perceive themovements of his body and could divine his thoughts to them the name george washingtonstill denoted something concrete in their own experience after his death they had to substitutememories for perceptions which involved a change in the mental processes taking place whenthey used his name for us who never knew him the mental processes are again different wemay think of his picture and say to ourselves yes that man we may think the first president ofthe united states if we are very ignorant he may be to us merely the man who was called george washington whatever the name suggests to us it must be not the man himself since wenever knew him but something now present to sense or memory or thought this shows thefallacy of the argument of parmenides this perpetual change in the meanings of words is concealed by the fact that in general thechange makes no difference to the truth or falsehood of the propositions in which the words occur if you take any true sentence in which the name george washington occurs it will as a ruleremain true if you substitute the phrase the first president of the united states there areexceptions to this rule before washingtons election a man might say i hope george washington will be the first president of the united states but he would not say i hope the first president of the united states will be the first president of the united states unless he had anunusual passion for the law of identity but it is easy to make a rule for excluding theseexceptional cases and in those that remain you may substitute for george washington anydescriptive phrase that applies to him alone and it is only by means of such phrases that we knowwhat we know about him parmenides contends that since we can now know what is commonly regarded as past it cannotreally be past but must in some sense exist now hence he infers that there is no such thing aschange what we have been saying about george washington meets this argument it may be said in a sense that we have no knowledge of the past when yourecollect the recollection occurs now and is not identical with the event recollected but therecollection affords a description of the past event and for most practical purposes it isunnecessary to distinguish between the description and what it describes this whole argument shows how easy it is to draw metaphysical conclusions from language andhow the only way to avoid fallacious arguments of this kind is to push the logical andpsychological study of language further than has been done by most metaphysicians i think however that if parmenides could return from the dead and read what i have been sayinghe would regard it as very superficial how do you know he would ask that your statementsabout george washington refer to a past time by your own account the direct reference is tothings now present your recollections for instance happen now not at the time that you thinkyou recollect if memory is to be accepted as a source of knowledge the past must be before themind now and must therefore in some sense still exist i will not attempt to meet this argument now it requires a discussion of memory which is adifficult subject i have put the argument here to remind the reader that philosophical theories ifthey are important can generally be revived in a new form after being refuted as originally stated refutations are seldom final in most cases they are only a prelude to further refinements what subsequent philosophy down to quite modern times accepted from parmenides was not theimpossibility of all change which was too violent a paradox but the indestructibility of substance the word substance did not occur in his immediate successors but the concept is alreadypresent in their speculations a substance was supposed to be the persistent subject of varyingpredicates as such it became and remained for more than two thousand years one of thefundamental concepts of philosophy psychology physics and theology i shall have much to sayabout it at a later stage for the present i am merely concerned to note that it was introduced as away of doing justice to the arguments of parmenides without denying obvious facts

men living together according to reason without a common superior on earth with authorityto judge between them is properly the state of nature this is not a description of the life of savages but of an imagined community of virtuousanarchists who need no police or lawcourts because they always obey reason which is thesame as natural law which in turn consists of those laws of conduct that are held to have adivine origin some further quotations will make lockes meaning clearer to understand political power right he says and derive it from its original we must considerwhat state men are naturally in and that is a state of perfect freedom to order their actions anddispose of their possessions and persons as they think fit within the bounds of the law ofnature without asking leave or depending upon the will of any other man a state also of equality wherein all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal no one havingmore than another there being nothing more evident than that creatures of the same speciesand rank promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature and the use of the samefaculties should also be equal one amongst another without subordination or subjection unlessthe lord and master of them all should by any manifest declaration of his will set one aboveanother and confer on him by an evident and clear appointment an undoubted right todominion and sovereignty but though this the state of nature be a state of liberty yet it is not a state of licence thoughman in that state has an uncontrollable liberty to dispose of his person or possessions yet he hasnot liberty to destroy himself or so much as any creature in his possession but where somenobler use than its bare preservation calls for it the state of nature has a law of nature togovern it which obliges every one and reason which is that law teaches all mankind who winbut consult it that being all equal and independent no one ought to harm another in his lifehealth liberty or possessions   cf the declaration of independence they are his property whose workmanship they are made to last during his not anotherspleasure as locke puts it it presently appears however that where most men are in the state of nature there maynevertheless be some men who do not live according to the law of nature and that the law ofnature provides up to a point what may be done to resist such criminals in a state of nature weare told every man can defend himself and what is his who so sheddeth mans blood by manshall his blood be shed is part of the law of nature i may even kill a thief while he is engaged instealing my property and this right survives the institution of government although where thereis government if the thief gets away i must renounce private vengeance and resort to the law the great objection to the state of nature is that while it persists every man is the judge in hisown cause since he must rely upon himself for the defence of his rights for this evil governmentis the remedy but this is not a natural remedy the state of nature according to locke wasevaded by a compact to create a government not any compact ends the state of nature but onlythat of making one body politic the various governments of independent states are now in a stateof nature towards each other the state of nature we are told in a passage presumably directed against hobbes is not the sameas a state of war but more nearly its opposite after explaining the right to kill a thief on theground that the thief may be deemed to be making war upon me locke says and here we have the plain difference between the state of nature and the state of war whichhowever some men have confounded are as far distant as a state of peace goodwill mutualassistance and preservation and a state of enmity malice violence and mutual destruction arefrom one another perhaps the law of nature must be regarded as having a wider scope than the state of nature sincethe former deals with thieves and murderers while in the latter there are no such malefactors this at least suggests a way out of an apparent inconsistency in locke consisting in hissometimes representing the state of nature as one where every one is virtuous and at other timesdiscussing what may rightly be done in a state of nature to resist the aggressions of wicked men some parts of lockes natural law are surprising for example he says that captives in a just warare slaves by the law of nature he says also that by nature every man has a right to punish attackson himself or his property even by death he makes no qualification so 
it presently appears however that where most men are in the state of nature there maynevertheless be some men who do not live according to the law of nature and that the law ofnature provides up to a point what may be done to resist such criminals in a state of nature weare told every man can defend himself and what is his who so sheddeth mans blood by manshall his blood be shed is part of the law of nature i may even kill a thief while he is engaged instealing my property and this right survives the institution of government although where thereis government if the thief gets away i must renounce private vengeance and resort to the law the great objection to the state of nature is that while it persists every man is the judge in hisown cause since he must rely upon himself for the defence of his rights for this evil governmentis the remedy but this is not a natural remedy the state of nature according to locke wasevaded by a compact to create a government not any compact ends the state of nature but onlythat of making one body politic the various governments of independent states are now in a stateof nature towards each other the state of nature we are told in a passage presumably directed against hobbes is not the sameas a state of war but more nearly its opposite after explaining the right to kill a thief on theground that the thief may be deemed to be making war upon me locke says and here we have the plain difference between the state of nature and the state of war whichhowever some men have confounded are as far distant as a state of peace goodwill mutualassistance and preservation and a state of enmity malice violence and mutual destruction arefrom one another perhaps the law of nature must be regarded as having a wider scope than the state of nature sincethe former deals with thieves and murderers while in the latter there are no such malefactors this at least suggests a way out of an apparent inconsistency in locke consisting in hissometimes representing the state of nature as one where every one is virtuous and at other timesdiscussing what may rightly be done in a state of nature to resist the aggressions of wicked men some parts of lockes natural law are surprising for example he says that captives in a just warare slaves by the law of nature he says also that by nature every man has a right to punish attackson himself or his property even by death he makes no qualification so that if i catch a person engaged in petty pilfering i have apparently by the law of nature a right toshoot him property is very prominent in lockes political philosophy and is according to him the chiefreason for the institution of civil government the great and chief end of men uniting into commonwealths and putting themselves undergovernment is the preservation of their property to which in the state of nature there are manythings wanting the whole of this theory of the state of nature and natural law is in one sense clear but in anothervery puzzling it is clear what locke thought but it is not clear how he can have thought it lockes ethic as we saw is utilitarian but in his consideration of rights he does not bring inutilitarian considerations something of this pervades the whole philosophy of law as taught bylawyers legal rights can be defined broadly speaking a man has a legal right when he can appealto the law to safeguard him against injury a man has in general a legal right to his property but ifhe has an illicit store of cocaine he has no legal remedy against a man who steals it but thelawgiver has to decide what legal rights to create and falls back naturally on the conception ofnatural rights as those which the law should secure i am attempting to go as far as is possible towards stating something like lockes theory inuntheological terms if it is assumed that ethics and the classification of acts as right andwrong is logically prior to actual law it becomes possible to restate the theory in terms notinvolving mythical history to arrive at the law of nature we may put the question in this way inthe absence of law and government what classes of acts by a against b justify b in retaliatingagainst a and what sort of retaliation is justified in different cases it is generally held that noman can be blamed for defending himself against a murderous assault even if necessary to theextent of killing the assailant he may equally defend his wife and children or indeed anymember of the general public in such cases the existence of the law against murder becomesirrelevant if as may easily happen the man assaulted would be dead before the aid of the policecould be invoked we have therefore to fall back on natural right a man 
that if i catch a person engaged in petty pilfering i have apparently by the law of nature a right toshoot him property is very prominent in lockes political philosophy and is according to him the chiefreason for the institution of civil government the great and chief end of men uniting into commonwealths and putting themselves undergovernment is the preservation of their property to which in the state of nature there are manythings wanting the whole of this theory of the state of nature and natural law is in one sense clear but in anothervery puzzling it is clear what locke thought but it is not clear how he can have thought it lockes ethic as we saw is utilitarian but in his consideration of rights he does not bring inutilitarian considerations something of this pervades the whole philosophy of law as taught bylawyers legal rights can be defined broadly speaking a man has a legal right when he can appealto the law to safeguard him against injury a man has in general a legal right to his property but ifhe has an illicit store of cocaine he has no legal remedy against a man who steals it but thelawgiver has to decide what legal rights to create and falls back naturally on the conception ofnatural rights as those which the law should secure i am attempting to go as far as is possible towards stating something like lockes theory inuntheological terms if it is assumed that ethics and the classification of acts as right andwrong is logically prior to actual law it becomes possible to restate the theory in terms notinvolving mythical history to arrive at the law of nature we may put the question in this way inthe absence of law and government what classes of acts by a against b justify b in retaliatingagainst a and what sort of retaliation is justified in different cases it is generally held that noman can be blamed for defending himself against a murderous assault even if necessary to theextent of killing the assailant he may equally defend his wife and children or indeed anymember of the general public in such cases the existence of the law against murder becomesirrelevant if as may easily happen the man assaulted would be dead before the aid of the policecould be invoked we have therefore to fall back on natural right a man also has a right to defend his property though opinions differ as to the amount of injury he mayjustly inflict upon a thief in the relations between states as locke points out natural law is relevant in whatcircumstances is war justified so long as no international government exists the answer to thisquestion is purely ethical not legal it must be answered in the same way as it would be for anindividual in a state of anarchy legal theory will be based upon the view that the rights of individuals should be protected bythe state that is to say when a man suffers the kind of injury which would justify retaliationaccording to the principles of natural law positive law should enact that the retaliation shall bedone by the state if you see a man making a murderous assault upon your brother you have aright to kill him if you cannot otherwise save your brother in a state of natureso at least lockeholdsif a man has succeeded in killing your brother you have a right to kill him but where lawexists you lose this right which is taken over by the state and if you kill in selffence or indefence of another you will have to prove to a lawcourt that this was the reason for the killing we may then identify natural law with moral rules in so far as they are independent of positivelegal enactments there must be such rules if there is to be any distinction between good and badlaws for locke the matter is simple since moral rules have been laid down by god and are to befound in the bible when this theological basis is removed the matter becomes more difficult butso long as it is held that there is an ethical distinction between right actions and wrong ones wecan say natural law decides what actions would be ethically right and what wrong in acommunity that had no government and positive law ought to be as far as possible guided andinspired by natural law in its absolute form the doctrine that an individual has certain inalienable rights is incompatiblewith utilitarianism ie with the doctrine that right acts are those that do most to promote thegeneral happiness but in order that a doctrine may be a suitable basis for law it is not necessarythat it should be true in every possible case but only that it should be true in an overwhelmingmajority of cases we can all imagine cases in which murder would be justifiable but they arerare and do not afford an argument against the illegality of murder 
also has a right to defend his property though opinions differ as to the amount of injury he mayjustly inflict upon a thief in the relations between states as locke points out natural law is relevant in whatcircumstances is war justified so long as no international government exists the answer to thisquestion is purely ethical not legal it must be answered in the same way as it would be for anindividual in a state of anarchy legal theory will be based upon the view that the rights of individuals should be protected bythe state that is to say when a man suffers the kind of injury which would justify retaliationaccording to the principles of natural law positive law should enact that the retaliation shall bedone by the state if you see a man making a murderous assault upon your brother you have aright to kill him if you cannot otherwise save your brother in a state of natureso at least lockeholdsif a man has succeeded in killing your brother you have a right to kill him but where lawexists you lose this right which is taken over by the state and if you kill in selffence or indefence of another you will have to prove to a lawcourt that this was the reason for the killing we may then identify natural law with moral rules in so far as they are independent of positivelegal enactments there must be such rules if there is to be any distinction between good and badlaws for locke the matter is simple since moral rules have been laid down by god and are to befound in the bible when this theological basis is removed the matter becomes more difficult butso long as it is held that there is an ethical distinction between right actions and wrong ones wecan say natural law decides what actions would be ethically right and what wrong in acommunity that had no government and positive law ought to be as far as possible guided andinspired by natural law in its absolute form the doctrine that an individual has certain inalienable rights is incompatiblewith utilitarianism ie with the doctrine that right acts are those that do most to promote thegeneral happiness but in order that a doctrine may be a suitable basis for law it is not necessarythat it should be true in every possible case but only that it should be true in an overwhelmingmajority of cases we can all imagine cases in which murder would be justifiable but they arerare and do not afford an argument against the illegality of murder similarly it may bei am not saying that it isdesirable from a utilitarian point of view toreserve to each individual a certain sphere of personal liberty if so the doctrine of the rights of man will be a suitable basis for the appropriate laws even though these rights be subject toexceptions a utilitarian will have to examine the doctrine considered as a basis for laws fromthe point of view of its practical effects he cannot condemn it ab initio as contrary to his ownethic c the social contract in the political speculation of the seventeenth century there were two main types of theory as tothe origin of government of one type we have had an example in sir robert filmer this typemaintained that god had bestowed power on certain persons and that these persons or their heirsconstituted the legitimate government rebellion against which is not only treason but impiety this view was sanctioned by sentiments of immemorial antiquity in almost all early civilizationsthe king is a sacred person kings naturally considered it an admirable theory aristocracies hadmotives for supporting it and motives for opposing it in its favour was the fact that it emphasizedthe hereditary principle and that it gave august support to resistance against the upstart merchantclass where the middle class was more feared or hated by the aristocracy than the king was thesemotives prevailed where the contrary was the case and especially where the aristocracy had achance of obtaining supreme power itself it tended to oppose the king and therefore to rejecttheories of divine right the other main type of theoryof which locke is a representative maintained that civilgovernment is the result of a contract and is an affair purely of this world not somethingestablished by divine authority some writers regarded the social contract as a historical factothers as a legal fiction the important matter for all of them was to find a terrestrial origin forgovernmental authority in fact they could not think of any alternative to divine right except thesupposed contract it was felt by all except rebels that some reason must be found for obeyinggovernments and it was not thought sufficient to say that for most people the authority ofgovernment is con 
similarly it may bei am not saying that it isdesirable from a utilitarian point of view toreserve to each individual a certain sphere of personal liberty if so the doctrine of the rights of man will be a suitable basis for the appropriate laws even though these rights be subject toexceptions a utilitarian will have to examine the doctrine considered as a basis for laws fromthe point of view of its practical effects he cannot condemn it ab initio as contrary to his ownethic c the social contract in the political speculation of the seventeenth century there were two main types of theory as tothe origin of government of one type we have had an example in sir robert filmer this typemaintained that god had bestowed power on certain persons and that these persons or their heirsconstituted the legitimate government rebellion against which is not only treason but impiety this view was sanctioned by sentiments of immemorial antiquity in almost all early civilizationsthe king is a sacred person kings naturally considered it an admirable theory aristocracies hadmotives for supporting it and motives for opposing it in its favour was the fact that it emphasizedthe hereditary principle and that it gave august support to resistance against the upstart merchantclass where the middle class was more feared or hated by the aristocracy than the king was thesemotives prevailed where the contrary was the case and especially where the aristocracy had achance of obtaining supreme power itself it tended to oppose the king and therefore to rejecttheories of divine right the other main type of theoryof which locke is a representative maintained that civilgovernment is the result of a contract and is an affair purely of this world not somethingestablished by divine authority some writers regarded the social contract as a historical factothers as a legal fiction the important matter for all of them was to find a terrestrial origin forgovernmental authority in fact they could not think of any alternative to divine right except thesupposed contract it was felt by all except rebels that some reason must be found for obeyinggovernments and it was not thought sufficient to say that for most people the authority ofgovernment is con venient government must in some sense have a right to exact obedience and the right conferredby a contract seemed the only alternative to a divine command consequently the doctrine thatgovernment was instituted by a contract was popular with practically all opponents of divine rightof kings there is a hint of this theory in thomas aquinas but the first serious development of itis to be found in grotius the contract doctrine was capable of taking forms which justified tyranny hobbes for exampleheld that there was a contract among the citizens to hand over all power to the chosen sovereignbut the sovereign was not a party to the contract and therefore necessarily acquired unlimitedauthority this theory at first might have justified cromwells totalitarian state after the restoration it justified charles ii in lockes form of the doctrine however the government is aparty to the contract and can be justly resisted if it fails to fulfil its part of the bargain lockesdoctrine is in essence more or less democratic but the democratic element is limited by the view that those who have no property are not to be reckoned as citizens let us now see just what locke has to say on our present topic there is first a definition of political power political power i take to be the right of making laws with penalty of death and consequently allless penalties for the regulating and preserving of property and of employing the force of thecommunity in the execution of such laws and in the defence of the commonwealth from foreigninjury and all this only for the public good government we are told is a remedy for the inconveniences that arise in the state of naturefrom the fact that in that state every man is the judge in his own cause but where the monarch isa party to the dispute this is no remedy since the monarch is both judge and plaintiff theseconsiderations lead to the view that governments should not be absolute and that the judiciaryshould be independent of the executive such arguments had an important future both in englandand in america but for the moment we are not concerned with them by nature locke says every man has the right to punish attacks on himself or his property evenby death there is political society 
venient government must in some sense have a right to exact obedience and the right conferredby a contract seemed the only alternative to a divine command consequently the doctrine thatgovernment was instituted by a contract was popular with practically all opponents of divine rightof kings there is a hint of this theory in thomas aquinas but the first serious development of itis to be found in grotius the contract doctrine was capable of taking forms which justified tyranny hobbes for exampleheld that there was a contract among the citizens to hand over all power to the chosen sovereignbut the sovereign was not a party to the contract and therefore necessarily acquired unlimitedauthority this theory at first might have justified cromwells totalitarian state after the restoration it justified charles ii in lockes form of the doctrine however the government is aparty to the contract and can be justly resisted if it fails to fulfil its part of the bargain lockesdoctrine is in essence more or less democratic but the democratic element is limited by the view that those who have no property are not to be reckoned as citizens let us now see just what locke has to say on our present topic there is first a definition of political power political power i take to be the right of making laws with penalty of death and consequently allless penalties for the regulating and preserving of property and of employing the force of thecommunity in the execution of such laws and in the defence of the commonwealth from foreigninjury and all this only for the public good government we are told is a remedy for the inconveniences that arise in the state of naturefrom the fact that in that state every man is the judge in his own cause but where the monarch isa party to the dispute this is no remedy since the monarch is both judge and plaintiff theseconsiderations lead to the view that governments should not be absolute and that the judiciaryshould be independent of the executive such arguments had an important future both in englandand in america but for the moment we are not concerned with them by nature locke says every man has the right to punish attacks on himself or his property evenby death there is political society there and there only where men have surrendered this right to the community or to the law absolute monarchy is not a form of civil government because there is no neutral authority todecide disputes between the monarch and a subject in fact the monarch in relation to his subjectsis still in a state of nature it is useless to hope that being a king will make a naturally violent manvirtuous he that would have been insolent and injurious in the woods of america would not probably bemuch better in a throne where perhaps learning and religion shall be found out to justify all thathe shall do to his subjects and the sword presently silence all those that dare question it absolute monarchy is as if men protected themselves against polecats and foxes but are contentnay think it safety to be devoured by lions civil society involves the rule of the majority unless it is agreed that a greater number shall berequired this sounds democratic but it must be remembered that locke assumes the exclusionof women and the poor from the rights of citizenship the beginning of politic society depends upon the consent of the individuals to join into andmake one society it is arguedsomewhat halfheartedlythat such consent must at some timehave actually taken place though it is admitted that the origin of government antedates historyeverywhere except among the jews the civil compact which institutes government binds only those who made it the son mustconsent afresh to a compact made by his father the power of the government by contract we are told never extends beyond the common good amoment ago i quoted a sentence as to the powers of government ending and all this only for thepublic good it seems not to have occurred to locke to ask who was to be the judge of thecommon good obviously if the government is the judge it will always decide in its own favour presumably 
this argument it may be said in a sense that we have no knowledge of the past when yourecollect the recollection occurs now and is not identical with the event recollected but therecollection affords a description of the past event and for most practical purposes it isunnecessary to distinguish between the description and what it describes this whole argument shows how easy it is to draw metaphysical conclusions from language andhow the only way to avoid fallacious arguments of this kind is to push the logical andpsychological study of language further than has been done by most metaphysicians i think however that if parmenides could return from the dead and read what i have been sayinghe would regard it as very superficial how do you know he would ask that your statementsabout george washington refer to a past time by your own account the direct reference is tothings now present your recollections for instance happen now not at the time that you thinkyou recollect if memory is to be accepted as a source of knowledge the past must be before themind now and must therefore in some sense still exist i will not attempt to meet this argument now it requires a discussion of memory which is adifficult subject i have put the argument here to remind the reader that philosophical theories ifthey are important can generally be revived in a new form after being refuted as originally stated refutations are seldom final in most cases they are only a prelude to further refinements what subsequent philosophy down to quite modern times accepted from parmenides was not theimpossibility of all change which was too violent a paradox but the indestructibility of substance the word substance did not occur in his immediate successors but the concept is alreadypresent in their speculations a substance was supposed to be the persistent subject of varyingpredicates as such it became and remained for more than two thousand years one of thefundamental concepts of philosophy psychology physics and theology i shall have much to sayabout it at a later stage for the present i am merely concerned to note that it was introduced as away of doing justice to the arguments of parmenides without denying obvious facts chapter vi empedocles the mixture of philosopher prophet man of science and charlatan which we found already in pythagoras was exemplified very completely in empedocles who flourished about bc andwas thus a younger contemporary of parmenides though his doctrine had in some ways moreaffinity with that of heraclitus he was a citizen of acragas on the south coast of sicily he was ademocratic politician who at the same time claimed to be a god in most greek cities andespecially in those of sicily there was a constant conflict between democracy and tyranny theleaders of whichever party was at the moment defeated were executed or exiled those who wereexiled seldom scrupled to enter into negotiations with the enemies of greecepersia in the east carthage in the west empedocles in due course was banished but he appears after hisbanishment to have preferred the career of a sage to that of an intriguing refugee it seemsprobable that in youth he was more or less orphic that before his exile he combined politics andscience and that it was only in later life as an exile that he became a prophet legend had much to say about empedocles he was supposed to have worked miracles or whatseemed such sometimes by magic sometimes by means of his scientific knowledge he couldcontrol the winds we are told he restored to life a woman who had seemed dead for thirty daysfinally it is said he died by leaping into the crater of etna to prove that he was a god in the wordsof the poet great empedocles that ardent soul leapt into etna and was roasted whole matthew arnold wrote a poem on this subject but although one of his worst it does not containthe above couplet like parmenides empedocles wrote in verse lucretius who was 
there and there only where men have surrendered this right to the community or to the law absolute monarchy is not a form of civil government because there is no neutral authority todecide disputes between the monarch and a subject in fact the monarch in relation to his subjectsis still in a state of nature it is useless to hope that being a king will make a naturally violent manvirtuous he that would have been insolent and injurious in the woods of america would not probably bemuch better in a throne where perhaps learning and religion shall be found out to justify all thathe shall do to his subjects and the sword presently silence all those that dare question it absolute monarchy is as if men protected themselves against polecats and foxes but are contentnay think it safety to be devoured by lions civil society involves the rule of the majority unless it is agreed that a greater number shall berequired this sounds democratic but it must be remembered that locke assumes the exclusionof women and the poor from the rights of citizenship the beginning of politic society depends upon the consent of the individuals to join into andmake one society it is arguedsomewhat halfheartedlythat such consent must at some timehave actually taken place though it is admitted that the origin of government antedates historyeverywhere except among the jews the civil compact which institutes government binds only those who made it the son mustconsent afresh to a compact made by his father the power of the government by contract we are told never extends beyond the common good amoment ago i quoted a sentence as to the powers of government ending and all this only for thepublic good it seems not to have occurred to locke to ask who was to be the judge of thecommon good obviously if the government is the judge it will always decide in its own favour presumably locke would say that the majority of the citizens is to be the judge but many questions have to bedecided too quickly for it to be possible to ascertain the opinion of the electorate of these peaceand war are perhaps the most important the only remedy in such cases is to allow to publicopinion or its representatives some powersuch as impeachmentof subsequently punishingexecutive officers for acts that are found to have been unpopular but often this is a veryinadequate remedy i quoted previously a sentence which i must now quote again the great and chief end of men uniting into commonwealths and putting themselves undergovernment is the preservation of their property consistently with this doctrine locke declares that the supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property without his own consentstill more surprising is the statement that although military commanders have power of life anddeath over their soldiers they have no power of taking money the question of taxation might be supposed to raise difficulties for locke but he perceives none the expense of government he says must be borne by the citizens but with their consent iewith that of the majority but why one asks should the consent of the majority suffice everymans consent we were told is necessary to justify the government in taking any part of hisproperty i suppose his tacit consent to taxation in accordance with majority decision is presumedto be involved in his citizenship which in turn is presumed to be voluntary all this is of coursesometimes quite contrary to the facts most men have no effective liberty of choice as to the stateto which they shall belong and very few have liberty nowadays to belong to no state supposefor example you are a pacifist and disapprove of war wherever you live the government willtake some of your property for warlike purposes with what justice can you be compelled tosubmit to this i can imagine many answers but i do not think any of them are consistent with lockes principles he thrusts in the maxim of majority rule without adequate consideration andoffers 
locke would say that the majority of the citizens is to be the judge but many questions have to bedecided too quickly for it to be possible to ascertain the opinion of the electorate of these peaceand war are perhaps the most important the only remedy in such cases is to allow to publicopinion or its representatives some powersuch as impeachmentof subsequently punishingexecutive officers for acts that are found to have been unpopular but often this is a veryinadequate remedy i quoted previously a sentence which i must now quote again the great and chief end of men uniting into commonwealths and putting themselves undergovernment is the preservation of their property consistently with this doctrine locke declares that the supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property without his own consentstill more surprising is the statement that although military commanders have power of life anddeath over their soldiers they have no power of taking money the question of taxation might be supposed to raise difficulties for locke but he perceives none the expense of government he says must be borne by the citizens but with their consent iewith that of the majority but why one asks should the consent of the majority suffice everymans consent we were told is necessary to justify the government in taking any part of hisproperty i suppose his tacit consent to taxation in accordance with majority decision is presumedto be involved in his citizenship which in turn is presumed to be voluntary all this is of coursesometimes quite contrary to the facts most men have no effective liberty of choice as to the stateto which they shall belong and very few have liberty nowadays to belong to no state supposefor example you are a pacifist and disapprove of war wherever you live the government willtake some of your property for warlike purposes with what justice can you be compelled tosubmit to this i can imagine many answers but i do not think any of them are consistent with lockes principles he thrusts in the maxim of majority rule without adequate consideration andoffers no transition to it from his individualistic premisses except the mythical social contract the social contract in the sense required is mythical even when at some former period thereactually was a contract creating the government in question the united states is a case in point at the time when the constitution was adopted men had liberty of choice even then many votedagainst it and were therefore not parties to the contract they could of course have left thecountry and by remaining were deemed to have become bound by a contract to which they hadnot assented but in practice it is usually difficult to leave ones country and in the case of menborn after the adoption of the constitution their consent is even more shadowy the question of the rights of the individual as against the government is a very difficult one it istoo readily assumed by democrats that when the government represents the majority it has a rightto coerce the minority up to a point this must be true since coercion is of the essence ofgovernment but the divine right of majorities if pressed too far may become almost as tyrannicalas the divine right of kings locke says little on this subject in his essays on government butconsiders it at some length in his letters on toleration where he argues that no believer in godshould be penalized on account of his religious opinions the theory that government was created by a contract is of course preevolutionary governmentlike measles and whoopingcough must have grown up gradually though like them it could beintroduced suddenly into new regions such as the south sea islands before men had studiedanthropology they had no idea of the psychological mechanisms involved in the beginnings ofgovernment or of the fantastic reasons which lead men to adopt institutions and customs thatsubsequently prove useful but as a legal fiction to justify government the theory of the socialcontract has some measure of truth d property from what has been said hitherto about lockes views on property it might seem as though hewere the champion of the great capitalists against both their social superiors and their socialinferiors but this would be only a halftruth one finds in him side by side and unrecon 
no transition to it from his individualistic premisses except the mythical social contract the social contract in the sense required is mythical even when at some former period thereactually was a contract creating the government in question the united states is a case in point at the time when the constitution was adopted men had liberty of choice even then many votedagainst it and were therefore not parties to the contract they could of course have left thecountry and by remaining were deemed to have become bound by a contract to which they hadnot assented but in practice it is usually difficult to leave ones country and in the case of menborn after the adoption of the constitution their consent is even more shadowy the question of the rights of the individual as against the government is a very difficult one it istoo readily assumed by democrats that when the government represents the majority it has a rightto coerce the minority up to a point this must be true since coercion is of the essence ofgovernment but the divine right of majorities if pressed too far may become almost as tyrannicalas the divine right of kings locke says little on this subject in his essays on government butconsiders it at some length in his letters on toleration where he argues that no believer in godshould be penalized on account of his religious opinions the theory that government was created by a contract is of course preevolutionary governmentlike measles and whoopingcough must have grown up gradually though like them it could beintroduced suddenly into new regions such as the south sea islands before men had studiedanthropology they had no idea of the psychological mechanisms involved in the beginnings ofgovernment or of the fantastic reasons which lead men to adopt institutions and customs thatsubsequently prove useful but as a legal fiction to justify government the theory of the socialcontract has some measure of truth d property from what has been said hitherto about lockes views on property it might seem as though hewere the champion of the great capitalists against both their social superiors and their socialinferiors but this would be only a halftruth one finds in him side by side and unrecon ciled doctrines which foreshadow those of developed capitalism and doctrines which adumbrate amore nearly socialistic outlook it is easy to misrepresent him by onesided quotations on thistopic as on most others i will put down in the order in which they occur lockes principal dicta on the subject ofproperty we are told first that every man has private property in the produce of his own labouror at leastshould have in preindustrial days this maxim was not so unrealistic as it has since become urban production was mainly by handicraftsmen who owned their tools and sold their produce as for agricultural production it was held by the school to which locke belonged that peasantproprietorship would be the best system he states that a man may own as much land as he cantill but not more he seems blandly unaware that in all the countries of europe the realization ofthis programme would be hardly possible without a bloody revolution everywhere the bulk ofagricultural land belonged to aristocrats who exacted from the farmers either a fixed proportion ofthe produce or a rent which could be varied from time to time the former systemprevailed in france and italy the latter in england farther east in russia and prussia theworkers were serfs who worked for the landowner and had virtually no rights the old systemwas ended in france by the french revolution in northern italy and western germany by theconquests of the french revolutionary armies serfdom was abolished in prussia as a result ofdefeat by napoleon and in russia as a result of defeat in the crimean war but in both countriesthe aristocrats retained their landed estates in east prussia this system though drasticallycontrolled by the nazis has survived to the present day in russia and what are now lithuania latvia and esthonia the aristocrats were dispossessed by the russian revolution in hungary rumania and poland they survived in eastern poland they were liquidated by the sovietgovernment in the soviet government however has done everything in its power tosubstitute collective farming rather than peasant proprietorship throughout russia in england the development has been more complex in lockes day the position of the rurallabourer was mitigated by the existence of commons on which he had important rights whichenabled him to 
ciled doctrines which foreshadow those of developed capitalism and doctrines which adumbrate amore nearly socialistic outlook it is easy to misrepresent him by onesided quotations on thistopic as on most others i will put down in the order in which they occur lockes principal dicta on the subject ofproperty we are told first that every man has private property in the produce of his own labouror at leastshould have in preindustrial days this maxim was not so unrealistic as it has since become urban production was mainly by handicraftsmen who owned their tools and sold their produce as for agricultural production it was held by the school to which locke belonged that peasantproprietorship would be the best system he states that a man may own as much land as he cantill but not more he seems blandly unaware that in all the countries of europe the realization ofthis programme would be hardly possible without a bloody revolution everywhere the bulk ofagricultural land belonged to aristocrats who exacted from the farmers either a fixed proportion ofthe produce or a rent which could be varied from time to time the former systemprevailed in france and italy the latter in england farther east in russia and prussia theworkers were serfs who worked for the landowner and had virtually no rights the old systemwas ended in france by the french revolution in northern italy and western germany by theconquests of the french revolutionary armies serfdom was abolished in prussia as a result ofdefeat by napoleon and in russia as a result of defeat in the crimean war but in both countriesthe aristocrats retained their landed estates in east prussia this system though drasticallycontrolled by the nazis has survived to the present day in russia and what are now lithuania latvia and esthonia the aristocrats were dispossessed by the russian revolution in hungary rumania and poland they survived in eastern poland they were liquidated by the sovietgovernment in the soviet government however has done everything in its power tosubstitute collective farming rather than peasant proprietorship throughout russia in england the development has been more complex in lockes day the position of the rurallabourer was mitigated by the existence of commons on which he had important rights whichenabled him to raise a considerable part of his food himself this system was a survival from the middle agesand was viewed with disapproval by modernminded men who pointed out that from the point ofview of production it was wasteful accordingly there was a movement for enclosure ofcommons which began under henry viii and continued under cromwell but did not becomestrong until about from that time onward for about ninety years one common after anotherwas enclosed and handed over to the local landowners each enclosure required an act of parliament and the aristocrats who controlled both houses of parliament ruthlessly used theirlegislative power to enrich themselves while thrusting agricultural labourers down to the verge ofstarvation gradually owing to the growth of industry the position of agricultural labourersimproved since otherwise they could not be prevented from migrating to the towns at present asa result of the taxation introduced by lloyd george the aristocrats have been compelled to partwith most of their rural property but those who also own urban or industrial property have beenable to hang on to their estates there has been no sudden revolution but a gradual transitionwhich is still in progress at present those aristocrats who are still rich owe their wealth to urbanor industrial property this long development may be regarded except in russia as in accordance with lockesprinciples the odd thing is that he could announce doctrines requiring so much revolution beforethey could be put into effect and yet show no sign that he thought the system existing in his dayunjust or that he was aware of its being different from the system that he advocated the labour theory of valueie the doctrine that the value of a product depends upon the labourexpended upon itwhich some attribute to karl marx and others to ricardo is to be found in locke and was suggested to him by a line of predecessors stretching back to aquinas as tawneysays summarizing scholastic doctrine the essence of the argument was that payment may properly be demanded by the craftsmen whomake the goods or by the merchants who transport them for both labour in their vocation andserve the common need the unpardonable sin is that of the speculator or middleman whosnatches private gain by the exploitation of public 
raise a considerable part of his food himself this system was a survival from the middle agesand was viewed with disapproval by modernminded men who pointed out that from the point ofview of production it was wasteful accordingly there was a movement for enclosure ofcommons which began under henry viii and continued under cromwell but did not becomestrong until about from that time onward for about ninety years one common after anotherwas enclosed and handed over to the local landowners each enclosure required an act of parliament and the aristocrats who controlled both houses of parliament ruthlessly used theirlegislative power to enrich themselves while thrusting agricultural labourers down to the verge ofstarvation gradually owing to the growth of industry the position of agricultural labourersimproved since otherwise they could not be prevented from migrating to the towns at present asa result of the taxation introduced by lloyd george the aristocrats have been compelled to partwith most of their rural property but those who also own urban or industrial property have beenable to hang on to their estates there has been no sudden revolution but a gradual transitionwhich is still in progress at present those aristocrats who are still rich owe their wealth to urbanor industrial property this long development may be regarded except in russia as in accordance with lockesprinciples the odd thing is that he could announce doctrines requiring so much revolution beforethey could be put into effect and yet show no sign that he thought the system existing in his dayunjust or that he was aware of its being different from the system that he advocated the labour theory of valueie the doctrine that the value of a product depends upon the labourexpended upon itwhich some attribute to karl marx and others to ricardo is to be found in locke and was suggested to him by a line of predecessors stretching back to aquinas as tawneysays summarizing scholastic doctrine the essence of the argument was that payment may properly be demanded by the craftsmen whomake the goods or by the merchants who transport them for both labour in their vocation andserve the common need the unpardonable sin is that of the speculator or middleman whosnatches private gain by the exploitation of public necessities the true descendant of the doctrines of aquinas is the labour theory of value the lastof the schoolmen was karl marx the labour theory of value has two aspects one ethical the other economic that is to say it mayassert that the value of a product ought to be proportional to the labour expended on it or that infact the labour regulates the price the latter doctrine is only approximately true as lockerecognizes nine tenths of value he says is due to labour but as to the other tenth he saysnothing it is labour he says that puts the difference of value on everything he instances land in america occupied by indians which has almost no value because the indians do not cultivate it he does not seem to realize that land may acquire value as soon as people are willing to work onit and before they have actually done so if you own a piece of desert land on which somebodyelse finds oil you can sell it for a good price without doing any work on it as was natural in hisday he does not think of such cases but only of agriculture peasant proprietorship which hefavours is inapplicable to such things as largescale mining which require expensive apparatusand many workers the principle that a man has a right to the produce of his own labour is useless in an industrialcivilization suppose you are employed in one operation in the manufacture of ford cars how isany one to estimate what proportion of the total output is due to your labour or suppose you areemployed by a railway company in the transport of goods who can decide what share you shall bedeemed to have in the production of the goods such considerations have led those who wish toprevent the exploitation of labour to abandon the principle of the right to your own produce infavour of more socialistic methods of organizing production and distribution the labour theory of value has usually been advocated from hostility to some class regarded aspredatory the schoolmen in so far as they held it did so from opposition to usurers who weremostly jews ricardo held it in opposition to landowners marx to capitalists but locke seems tohave held it in a vacuum without hostility to any class his only hostility is to monarchs but thisis unconnected with his views on value some of lockes opinions are so odd that i cannot see how to make them sound sensible he saysthat a man must not have so many plums that they are bound to go bad before he and his familycan eat them 
necessities the true descendant of the doctrines of aquinas is the labour theory of value the lastof the schoolmen was karl marx the labour theory of value has two aspects one ethical the other economic that is to say it mayassert that the value of a product ought to be proportional to the labour expended on it or that infact the labour regulates the price the latter doctrine is only approximately true as lockerecognizes nine tenths of value he says is due to labour but as to the other tenth he saysnothing it is labour he says that puts the difference of value on everything he instances land in america occupied by indians which has almost no value because the indians do not cultivate it he does not seem to realize that land may acquire value as soon as people are willing to work onit and before they have actually done so if you own a piece of desert land on which somebodyelse finds oil you can sell it for a good price without doing any work on it as was natural in hisday he does not think of such cases but only of agriculture peasant proprietorship which hefavours is inapplicable to such things as largescale mining which require expensive apparatusand many workers the principle that a man has a right to the produce of his own labour is useless in an industrialcivilization suppose you are employed in one operation in the manufacture of ford cars how isany one to estimate what proportion of the total output is due to your labour or suppose you areemployed by a railway company in the transport of goods who can decide what share you shall bedeemed to have in the production of the goods such considerations have led those who wish toprevent the exploitation of labour to abandon the principle of the right to your own produce infavour of more socialistic methods of organizing production and distribution the labour theory of value has usually been advocated from hostility to some class regarded aspredatory the schoolmen in so far as they held it did so from opposition to usurers who weremostly jews ricardo held it in opposition to landowners marx to capitalists but locke seems tohave held it in a vacuum without hostility to any class his only hostility is to monarchs but thisis unconnected with his views on value some of lockes opinions are so odd that i cannot see how to make them sound sensible he saysthat a man must not have so many plums that they are bound to go bad before he and his familycan eat them but he may have as much gold and as many diamonds as he can lawfully get because gold anddiamonds do not go bad it does not occur to him that the man who has the plums might sell thembefore they go bad he makes a great deal of the imperishable character of the precious metals which he says are thesource of money and inequality of fortune he seems in an abstract and academic way to regreteconomic inequality but he certainly does not think that it would be wise to take such measures asmight prevent it no doubt he was impressed as all the men of his time were by the gains tocivilization that were due to rich men chiefly as patrons of art and letters the same attitude existsin modern america where science and art are largely dependent upon the benefactions of the veryrich to some extent civilization is furthered by social injustice this fact is the basis of what ismost respectable in conservatism e checks and balances the doctrine that the legislative executive and judicial functions of government should be keptseparate is characteristic of liberalism it arose in england in the course of resistance to the stuarts and is clearly formulated by locke at least as regards the legislature and the executive the legislative and executive must be separate he says to prevent abuse of power it must ofcourse be understood that when he speaks of the legislature he means parliament and when hespeaks of the executive he means the king at least this is what he means emotionally whatever hemay logically intend to mean accordingly he thinks of the legislature as virtuous while theexecutive is usually wicked the legislative he says must be supreme except that it must be removable by the community itis implied that like the english house of commons the legislative is to be elected from time totime by popular vote the condition that the legislative is to be removable by the people if takenseriously condemns the part allowed by the british constitution in lockes day to king and lordsas part of the legislative power in all wellframed governments locke says the legislative and 
but he may have as much gold and as many diamonds as he can lawfully get because gold anddiamonds do not go bad it does not occur to him that the man who has the plums might sell thembefore they go bad he makes a great deal of the imperishable character of the precious metals which he says are thesource of money and inequality of fortune he seems in an abstract and academic way to regreteconomic inequality but he certainly does not think that it would be wise to take such measures asmight prevent it no doubt he was impressed as all the men of his time were by the gains tocivilization that were due to rich men chiefly as patrons of art and letters the same attitude existsin modern america where science and art are largely dependent upon the benefactions of the veryrich to some extent civilization is furthered by social injustice this fact is the basis of what ismost respectable in conservatism e checks and balances the doctrine that the legislative executive and judicial functions of government should be keptseparate is characteristic of liberalism it arose in england in the course of resistance to the stuarts and is clearly formulated by locke at least as regards the legislature and the executive the legislative and executive must be separate he says to prevent abuse of power it must ofcourse be understood that when he speaks of the legislature he means parliament and when hespeaks of the executive he means the king at least this is what he means emotionally whatever hemay logically intend to mean accordingly he thinks of the legislature as virtuous while theexecutive is usually wicked the legislative he says must be supreme except that it must be removable by the community itis implied that like the english house of commons the legislative is to be elected from time totime by popular vote the condition that the legislative is to be removable by the people if takenseriously condemns the part allowed by the british constitution in lockes day to king and lordsas part of the legislative power in all wellframed governments locke says the legislative and executive are separate the question therefore arises what is to be done when they conflict if theexecutive fails to summon the legislative at the proper times we are told the executive is at warwith the people and may be removed by force this is obviously a view suggested by whathappened under charles i from to he tried to govern without parliament this sort ofthing locke feels must be prevented by civil war if necessary force he says is to be opposed to nothing but unjust and unlawful force this principle isuseless in practice unless there exists some body with the legal right to pronounce when force isunjust and unlawful charles is attempt to collect shipmoney without the consent of parliamentwas declared by his opponents to be unjust and unlawful and by him to be just and lawful onlythe military issue of the civil war proved that his interpretation of the constitution was the wrongone the same thing happened in the american civil war had states the right to secede no oneknew and only the victory of the north decided the legal question the beliefwhich one finds in locke and in most writers of his timethat any honest man can know what is just and lawful isone that does not allow for the strength of party bias on both sides or for the difficulty ofestablishing a tribunal whether outwardly or in mens consciences that shall be capable ofpronouncing authoritatively on vexed questions in practice such questions if sufficientlyimportant are decided simply by power not by justice and law to some degree though in veiled language locke recognizes this fact in a dispute betweenlegislative and executive he says there is in certain cases no judge under heaven since heavendoes not make explicit pronouncements this means in effect that a decision can only be reachedby fighting since it is assumed that heaven will give the victory to the better cause some suchview is essential to any doctrine that divides governmental power where such a doctrine isembodied in the constitution the only way to avoid occasional civil war is to practisecompromise and common sense but compromise and common sense are habits of mind andcannot be embodied in a written constitution it is surprising that locke says nothing about the judiciary although this was a burning question inhis day until the revolution judges could at any moment be dismissed by the king consequently 
executive are separate the question therefore arises what is to be done when they conflict if theexecutive fails to summon the legislative at the proper times we are told the executive is at warwith the people and may be removed by force this is obviously a view suggested by whathappened under charles i from to he tried to govern without parliament this sort ofthing locke feels must be prevented by civil war if necessary force he says is to be opposed to nothing but unjust and unlawful force this principle isuseless in practice unless there exists some body with the legal right to pronounce when force isunjust and unlawful charles is attempt to collect shipmoney without the consent of parliamentwas declared by his opponents to be unjust and unlawful and by him to be just and lawful onlythe military issue of the civil war proved that his interpretation of the constitution was the wrongone the same thing happened in the american civil war had states the right to secede no oneknew and only the victory of the north decided the legal question the beliefwhich one finds in locke and in most writers of his timethat any honest man can know what is just and lawful isone that does not allow for the strength of party bias on both sides or for the difficulty ofestablishing a tribunal whether outwardly or in mens consciences that shall be capable ofpronouncing authoritatively on vexed questions in practice such questions if sufficientlyimportant are decided simply by power not by justice and law to some degree though in veiled language locke recognizes this fact in a dispute betweenlegislative and executive he says there is in certain cases no judge under heaven since heavendoes not make explicit pronouncements this means in effect that a decision can only be reachedby fighting since it is assumed that heaven will give the victory to the better cause some suchview is essential to any doctrine that divides governmental power where such a doctrine isembodied in the constitution the only way to avoid occasional civil war is to practisecompromise and common sense but compromise and common sense are habits of mind andcannot be embodied in a written constitution it is surprising that locke says nothing about the judiciary although this was a burning question inhis day until the revolution judges could at any moment be dismissed by the king consequently they condemned his enemies and acquitted his friends after the revolution they were madeirremovable except by an address from both houses of parliament it was thought that this wouldcause their decisions to be guided by the law in fact in cases involving party spirit it has merelysubstituted the judges prejudice for the kings however that may be wherever the principle ofchecks and balances prevailed the judiciary became a third independent branch of governmentalongside of the legislative and executive the most noteworthy example is the united states supreme court the history of the doctrine of checks and balances has been interesting in england the country of its origin it was intended to limit the power of the king who until the revolution had complete control of the executive gradually however the executive becamedependent upon parliament since it was impossible for a ministry to carry on without a majorityin the house of commons the executive thus became in effect a committee chosen in factthough not in form by parliament with the result that legislative and executive powers becamegradually less and less separate during the last fifty years or so a further development took placeowing to the prime ministers power of dissolution and to the increasing strictness of partydiscipline the majority in parliament now decides which party shall be in power but havingdecided that it cannot in practice decided anything else proposed legislation is hardly everenacted unless introduced by government thus the government is both legislative and executiveand its power is only limited by the need of occasional general elections this system is of coursetotally contrary to lockes principles in france where the doctrine was preached with great force by montesquieu it was held by themore moderate parties in the french revolution but was swept into temporary oblivion by thevictory of the jacobins napoleon naturally had no use for it but it was revived at the restorationto disappear again with the rise of napoleon iii it was again revived in and led to theadoption of a constitution in which the president had very little power and the government couldnot dissolve the chambers the result was to give great power to the chamber of deputies bothas against the government and as against the electorate there was more division of powers thanin 
they condemned his enemies and acquitted his friends after the revolution they were madeirremovable except by an address from both houses of parliament it was thought that this wouldcause their decisions to be guided by the law in fact in cases involving party spirit it has merelysubstituted the judges prejudice for the kings however that may be wherever the principle ofchecks and balances prevailed the judiciary became a third independent branch of governmentalongside of the legislative and executive the most noteworthy example is the united states supreme court the history of the doctrine of checks and balances has been interesting in england the country of its origin it was intended to limit the power of the king who until the revolution had complete control of the executive gradually however the executive becamedependent upon parliament since it was impossible for a ministry to carry on without a majorityin the house of commons the executive thus became in effect a committee chosen in factthough not in form by parliament with the result that legislative and executive powers becamegradually less and less separate during the last fifty years or so a further development took placeowing to the prime ministers power of dissolution and to the increasing strictness of partydiscipline the majority in parliament now decides which party shall be in power but havingdecided that it cannot in practice decided anything else proposed legislation is hardly everenacted unless introduced by government thus the government is both legislative and executiveand its power is only limited by the need of occasional general elections this system is of coursetotally contrary to lockes principles in france where the doctrine was preached with great force by montesquieu it was held by themore moderate parties in the french revolution but was swept into temporary oblivion by thevictory of the jacobins napoleon naturally had no use for it but it was revived at the restorationto disappear again with the rise of napoleon iii it was again revived in and led to theadoption of a constitution in which the president had very little power and the government couldnot dissolve the chambers the result was to give great power to the chamber of deputies bothas against the government and as against the electorate there was more division of powers thanin modern england but less than there should be on lockes principles since the legislatureovershadowed the executive what the french constitution will be after the present war it isimpossible to foresee the country where lockes principle of the division of powers has found its fullest application isthe united states where the president and congress are wholly independent of each other and the supreme court is independent of both inadvertently the constitution made the supreme court abranch of the legislature since nothing is a law if the supreme court says it is not the fact thatits powers are nominally only interpretative in reality increases those powers since it makes itdifficult to criticize what are supposed to be purely legal decisions it says a very great deal for thepolitical sagacity of americans that this constitution has only once led to armed conflict lockes political philosophy was on the whole adequate and useful until the industrial revolution since then it has been increasingly unable to tackle the important problems the power ofproperty as embodied in vast corporations grew beyond anything imagined by locke thenecessary functions of the statefor example in

nature as locke saysstill exists as between states a new international social contract is necessary before we canenjoy the promised benefits of government when once an international government has beencreated much of lockes political philosophy will again become applicable though not the part ofit that deals with private property chapter xv lockes influence from the time of locke down to the present day there have been in europe two main types ofphilosophy and one of these owes both its doctrines and its method to locke while the other wasderived first from descartes and then from kant kant himself thought that he had made asynthesis of the philosophy derived from descartes and that derived from locke but this cannotbe admitted at least from a historical point of view for the followers of kant were in the cartesian not the lockean tradition the heirs of locke are first berkeley and hume secondthose of the french philosophes who did not belong to the school of rousseau third benthamand the philosophical radicals fourth with important accretions from continental philosophy marx and his disciples but marxs system is eclectic and any simple statement about it is almostsure to be false i will therefore leave him on one side until i come to consider him in detail in lockes own day his chief philosophical opponents were the cartesians and leibniz quiteillogically the victory of lockes philosophy in england and france was largely due to theprestige of newton descartes authority as a philosopher was enhanced in his own day by hiswork in mathematics and natural philosophy but his doctrine of vortices was definitely inferior to newtons law of gravitation as an explanation of the solar system the victory of the newtoniancosmogony diminished mens respect for descartes and increased their respect for england boththese causes inclined men favourably towards locke in eighteenthcentury france where theintellectuals were in rebellion against an antiquated corrupt and effete despotism they regarded england as the home of freedom and were predisposed in favour of lockes philosophy by hispolitical doctrines in the last times before the revolution lockes influence

beencreated much of lockes political philosophy will again become applicable though not the part ofit that deals with private property chapter xv lockes influence from the time of locke down to the present day there have been in europe two main types ofphilosophy and one of these owes both its doctrines and its method to locke while the other wasderived first from descartes and then from kant kant himself thought that he had made asynthesis of the philosophy derived from descartes and that derived from locke but this cannotbe admitted at least from a historical point of view for the followers of kant were in the cartesian not the lockean tradition the heirs of locke are first berkeley and hume secondthose of the french philosophes who did not belong to the school of rousseau third benthamand the philosophical radicals fourth with important accretions from continental philosophy marx and his disciples but marxs system is eclectic and any simple statement about it is almostsure to be false i will therefore leave him on one side until i come to consider him in detail in lockes own day his chief philosophical opponents were the cartesians and leibniz quiteillogically the victory of lockes philosophy in england and france was largely due to theprestige of newton descartes authority as a philosopher was enhanced in his own day by hiswork in mathematics and natural philosophy but his doctrine of vortices was definitely inferior to newtons law of gravitation as an explanation of the solar system the victory of the newtoniancosmogony diminished mens respect for descartes and increased their respect for england boththese causes inclined men favourably towards locke in eighteenthcentury france where theintellectuals were in rebellion against an antiquated corrupt and effete despotism they regarded england as the home of freedom and were predisposed in favour of lockes philosophy by hispolitical doctrines in the last times before the revolution lockes influence in france was reinforced by that of hume who lived for a time in france and was personallyacquainted with many of the leading savants the chief transmitter of english influence to france was voltaire in england the philosophical followers of locke until the french revolution took no interestin his political doctrines berkeley was a bishop not much interested in politics hume was a tory who followed the lead of bolingbroke england was politically quiescent in their time anda philosopher could be content to theorize without troubling himself about the state of theworld the french revolution changed this and forced the best minds into opposition to thestatus quo nevertheless the tradition in pure philosophy remained unbroken shelley necessityof atheism for which he was expelled from oxford is full of lockes influence until the publication of kant critique of pure reason in it might have seemed as if theolder philosophical tradition of descartes spinoza and leibniz were being definitely overcomeby the newer empirical method this newer method however had never prevailed in germanuniversities and after it was held responsible for the horrors of the revolution recantingrevolutionaries such as coleridge found in kant an intellectual support for their opposition to french atheism the germans in their resistance to the french were glad to have a germanphilosophy to uphold them even the french after the fall of napoleon were glad of anyweapon against jacobinism all these factors favoured kant kant like darwin gave rise to a movement which he would have detested kant was a liberal ademocrat a pacifist but those who professed to develop his philosophy were none of thesethings or if they still called themselves liberals they were liberals of a new species since rousseau and kant there have been two schools of liberalism which may be distinguished asthe hardheaded and the softhearted the hardheaded developed through bentham ricardoand marx by logical stages into stalin the softhearted by other logical stages through fichte byron carlyle and nietzsche into hitler this statement of course is too

chapter vi empedocles the mixture of philosopher prophet man of science and charlatan which we found already in pythagoras was exemplified very completely in empedocles who flourished about bc andwas thus a younger contemporary of parmenides though his doctrine had in some ways moreaffinity with that of heraclitus he was a citizen of acragas on the south coast of sicily he was ademocratic politician who at the same time claimed to be a god in most greek cities andespecially in those of sicily there was a constant conflict between democracy and tyranny theleaders of whichever party was at the moment defeated were executed or exiled those who wereexiled seldom scrupled to enter into negotiations with the enemies of greecepersia in the east carthage in the west empedocles in due course was banished but he appears after hisbanishment to have preferred the career of a sage to that of an intriguing refugee it seemsprobable that in youth he was more or less orphic that before his exile he combined politics andscience and that it was only in later life as an exile that he became a prophet legend had much to say about empedocles he was supposed to have worked miracles or whatseemed such sometimes by magic sometimes by means of his scientific knowledge he couldcontrol the winds we are told he restored to life a woman who had seemed dead for thirty daysfinally it is said he died by leaping into the crater of etna to prove that he was a god in the wordsof the poet great empedocles that ardent soul leapt into etna and was roasted whole matthew arnold wrote a poem on this subject but although one of his worst it does not containthe above couplet like parmenides empedocles wrote in verse lucretius who was influenced by him praised him highly as a poet but on this subject opinions were divided sinceonly fragments of his writings have survived his poetic merit must remain in doubt it is necessary to deal separately with his science and his religion as they are not consistent witheach other i shall consider first his science then his philosophy and finally his religion his most important contribution to science was his discovery of air as a separate substance thishe proved by the observation that when a bucket or any similar vessel is put upside down intowater the water does not enter into the bucket he says when a girl playing with a waterclock of shining brass puts the orifice of the pipe upon hercomely hand and dips the waterclock into the yielding mass of silvery water the stream does notthen flow into the vessel but the bulk of the air inside pressing upon the closepackedperforations keeps it out till she uncovers the compressed stream but then air escapes and anequal volume of water runs in this passage occurs in an explanation of respiration he also discovered at least one example of centrifugal force that if a cup of water is whirledround at the end of a string the water does not come out he knew that there is sex in plants and he had a theory of evolution and the survival of the fittest originally countless tribes of mortal creatures werescattered abroad endowed with all manner of forms a wonder to behold there were headswithout necks arms without shoulders eyes without foreheads solitary limbs seeking for union these things joined together as each might chance there were shambling creatures with countlesshands creatures with faces and breasts looking in different directions creatures with the bodies ofoxen and the faces of men and others with the faces of oxen and the bodies of men there werehermaphrodites combining the natures of men and women but sterile in the end only certainforms survived as regards astronomy he knew that the moon shines by reflected light and thought that this isalso true of the sun he said that light takes time to travel but so little time that we cannot observeit he knew that solar eclipses are caused by the interposition of the moon a fact which he seemsto have learnt from anaxagoras

influenced by him praised him highly as a poet but on this subject opinions were divided sinceonly fragments of his writings have survived his poetic merit must remain in doubt it is necessary to deal separately with his science and his religion as they are not consistent witheach other i shall consider first his science then his philosophy and finally his religion his most important contribution to science was his discovery of air as a separate substance thishe proved by the observation that when a bucket or any similar vessel is put upside down intowater the water does not enter into the bucket he says when a girl playing with a waterclock of shining brass puts the orifice of the pipe upon hercomely hand and dips the waterclock into the yielding mass of silvery water the stream does notthen flow into the vessel but the bulk of the air inside pressing upon the closepackedperforations keeps it out till she uncovers the compressed stream but then air escapes and anequal volume of water runs in this passage occurs in an explanation of respiration he also discovered at least one example of centrifugal force that if a cup of water is whirledround at the end of a string the water does not come out he knew that there is sex in plants and he had a theory of evolution and the survival of the fittest originally countless tribes of mortal creatures werescattered abroad endowed with all manner of forms a wonder to behold there were headswithout necks arms without shoulders eyes without foreheads solitary limbs seeking for union these things joined together as each might chance there were shambling creatures with countlesshands creatures with faces and breasts looking in different directions creatures with the bodies ofoxen and the faces of men and others with the faces of oxen and the bodies of men there werehermaphrodites combining the natures of men and women but sterile in the end only certainforms survived as regards astronomy he knew that the moon shines by reflected light and thought that this isalso true of the sun he said that light takes time to travel but so little time that we cannot observeit he knew that solar eclipses are caused by the interposition of the moon a fact which he seemsto have learnt from anaxagoras he was the founder of the italian school of medicine and the medical school which sprang fromhim influenced both plato and aristotle according to burnet it affected the wholetendency of scientific and philosophical thinking all this shows the scientific vigour of his time which was not equalled in the later ages of greece i come now to his cosmology it was he as already mentioned who established earth air fire andwater as the four elements each of these waseverlasting but they could be mixed in different proportions and thus produce the changingcomplex substances that we find in the world they were combined by love and separated by strife love and strife were for empedocles primitive substances on a level with earth air fireand water there were periods when love was in the ascendant and others when strife was thestronger there had been a golden age when love was completely victorious in that age menworshipped only the cyprian aphrodite the changes in the world are not governed by anypurpose but only by chance and necessity there is a cycle when the elements have beenthoroughly mixed by love strife gradually sorts them out again when strife has separated them love gradually reunites them thus every compound substance is temporary only the elementstogether with love and strife are everlasting there is a similarity to heraclitus but a softening since it is not strife alone but strife and lovetogether that produce change plato couples heraclitus and empedocles in the sophist there are ionian and in more recent time sicilian muses who have arrived at the conclusion thatto unite the two principles is safer and to say that being is one andmany and that these are held together by enmity and friendship ever parting ever meeting as theseverer muses assert while the gentler ones do not insist on the perpetual strife and peace butadmit a relaxation and alternation of them peace and unity sometimes prevailing under the swayof aphrodite and then again plurality and war by reason of a principle of strife empedocles held that the material world is a sphere that in the golden age strife was outside and love inside then gradually strife 
discusses the view that we must distinguish the act of perceiving from the object perceived andthat the former is mental while the latter is not his argument against this view is obscure andnecessarily so since for one who believes in mental substance as berkeley does there is no validmeans of refuting it he says that any immediate object of the senses should exist in anunthinking substance or exterior to all minds is in itself an evident contradiction there is here afallacy analogous to the following it is impossible for a nephew to exist without an uncle now mr a is a nephew therefore it is logically necessary for mr a to have an uncle it is of courselogically necessary given that mr a is a nephew but not from anything to be discovered byanalysis of mr a so if something is an object of the senses some mind is concerned with it butit does not follow that the same thing could not have existed without being an object of the senses there is a somewhat analogous fallacy as regards what is conceived hylas maintains that he canconceive a house which no one perceives and which is not in any mind philonous retorts thatwhatever hylas conceives is in his mind so that the supposed house is after all mental hylasshould have answered i do not mean that i have in mind the image of a house when i say that ican conceive a house which no one perceives what i really mean is that i can understand theproposition there is a house which no one perceives or better still there is a house which no oneeither perceives or conceives this proposition is composed entirely of intelligible words andthe words are correctly put together whether the proposition is true or false i do not know but iam sure that it cannot be shown to be selfcontradictory some closely similar propositions can beproved for instance the number of possible multiplications of two integers is infinite thereforethere are some that have never been thought of berkeleys argument if valid would prove thatthis is impossible the fallacy involved is a very common one we can by means of concepts drawn fromexperience construct statements about classes some or all of whose members are not experienced take some perfectly ordinary concept say pebble this is an empirical concept derived fromperception but it does not follow that all pebbles are perceived unless we include the fact ofbeing perceived in our definition of pebble unless we do this the concept unperceived pebble is logically unobjectionable in spite of the fact that it is logically impossible to perceive aninstance of it schematically the argument is as follows berkeley says sensible objects must be sensible ais a sensible object therefore a must be sensible but if must indicates logical necessity theargument is only valid if a must be a sensible object the argument does not prove that fromthe properties of a other than its being sensible it can be deduced that a is sensible it does notprove for example that colours intrinsically indistinguishable from those that we see may notexist unseen we may believe on physiological grounds that this does not occur but suchgrounds are empirical so far as logic is concerned there is no reason why there should not becolours where there is no eye or brain i come now to berkeleys empirical arguments to begin with it is a sign of weakness tocombine empirical and logical arguments for the latter if valid make the former superfluous if i am contending that a square cannot be round i shall not appeal to the fact that no square inany known city is round but as we have rejected the logical arguments it becomes necessary toconsider the empirical arguments on their merits the first of the empirical arguments is an odd one that heat cannot be in the object becausethe most vehement and intense degree of heat is a very great pain and we cannot supposeany unperceiving thing capable of pain or pleasure there is an ambiguity in the word painof which berkeley takes advantage it may mean the painful quality of a sensation or it maymean the sensation that has this quality we say a broken leg is painful without implying thatthe leg is in the mind it might be similarly that heat causes pain and that this is all we oughtto mean when we say it is a pain this argument therefore is a poor one the argument about the hot and cold hands in lukewarm water strictly speaking would onlyprove that what we perceive in that experiment is not hot and cold but hotter and colder thereis nothing to prove that these are subjective in regard to tastes the argument from pleasure and pain is repeated sweetness is a pleasure andbitterness a pain therefore both are mental  eg i was not drunk last night i had only had two glasses besides it is well known that iam a teetotaller 
is logically unobjectionable in spite of the fact that it is logically impossible to perceive aninstance of it schematically the argument is as follows berkeley says sensible objects must be sensible ais a sensible object therefore a must be sensible but if must indicates logical necessity theargument is only valid if a must be a sensible object the argument does not prove that fromthe properties of a other than its being sensible it can be deduced that a is sensible it does notprove for example that colours intrinsically indistinguishable from those that we see may notexist unseen we may believe on physiological grounds that this does not occur but suchgrounds are empirical so far as logic is concerned there is no reason why there should not becolours where there is no eye or brain i come now to berkeleys empirical arguments to begin with it is a sign of weakness tocombine empirical and logical arguments for the latter if valid make the former superfluous if i am contending that a square cannot be round i shall not appeal to the fact that no square inany known city is round but as we have rejected the logical arguments it becomes necessary toconsider the empirical arguments on their merits the first of the empirical arguments is an odd one that heat cannot be in the object becausethe most vehement and intense degree of heat is a very great pain and we cannot supposeany unperceiving thing capable of pain or pleasure there is an ambiguity in the word painof which berkeley takes advantage it may mean the painful quality of a sensation or it maymean the sensation that has this quality we say a broken leg is painful without implying thatthe leg is in the mind it might be similarly that heat causes pain and that this is all we oughtto mean when we say it is a pain this argument therefore is a poor one the argument about the hot and cold hands in lukewarm water strictly speaking would onlyprove that what we perceive in that experiment is not hot and cold but hotter and colder thereis nothing to prove that these are subjective in regard to tastes the argument from pleasure and pain is repeated sweetness is a pleasure andbitterness a pain therefore both are mental  eg i was not drunk last night i had only had two glasses besides it is well known that iam a teetotaller it is also urged that a thing that tastes sweet when i am well may taste bitter when i am ill verysimilar arguments are used about odours since they are pleasant or unpleasant they cannot existin any but a perceiving substance or mind berkeley assumes here and everywhere that whatdoes not inhere in matter must inhere in a mental substance and that nothing can be both mentaland material the argument in regard to sound is ad hominem hylas says that sounds are really motions in theair and philonous retorts that motions can be seen or felt not heard so that real sounds areunaudible this is hardly a fair argument since percepts of motion according to berkeley are justas subjective as other percepts the motions that hylas requires will have to be unperceived andimperceptible nevertheless it is valid in so far as it points out that sound as heard cannot beidentified with the motions of air that physics regards as its cause hylas after abandoning secondary qualities is not yet ready to abandon primary qualities viz extension figure solidity gravity motion and rest the argument naturally concentrates onextension and motion if things have real sizes says philonous the same thing cannot be ofdifferent sizes at the same time and yet it looks larger when we are near it than when we are faroff and if motion is really in the object how comes it that the same motion may seem fast to oneand slow to another such arguments must i think be allowed to prove the subjectivity ofperceived space but this subjectivity is physical it is equally true of a camera and therefore doesnot prove that shape is mental in the second dialogue philonous sums up the discussion so faras it has gone in the words besides spirits all that we know or conceive are our own ideas heought not of course to make an exception for spirits since it is just as impossible to know spiritas to know matter the arguments in fact are almost identical in both cases let us now try to state what positive conclusions we can reach as a result of the kind of argumentinaugurated by berkeley things as we know them are bundles of sensible qualities a table for example consists of itsvisual shape its hardness the noise it emits when rapped and its smell these differentqualities have certain contiguities in experience which lead common sense to regard them asbelonging to one thing but the concept of thing or substance adds nothing to the perceivedqualities and is unnecessary so far we are on firm ground 
it is also urged that a thing that tastes sweet when i am well may taste bitter when i am ill verysimilar arguments are used about odours since they are pleasant or unpleasant they cannot existin any but a perceiving substance or mind berkeley assumes here and everywhere that whatdoes not inhere in matter must inhere in a mental substance and that nothing can be both mentaland material the argument in regard to sound is ad hominem hylas says that sounds are really motions in theair and philonous retorts that motions can be seen or felt not heard so that real sounds areunaudible this is hardly a fair argument since percepts of motion according to berkeley are justas subjective as other percepts the motions that hylas requires will have to be unperceived andimperceptible nevertheless it is valid in so far as it points out that sound as heard cannot beidentified with the motions of air that physics regards as its cause hylas after abandoning secondary qualities is not yet ready to abandon primary qualities viz extension figure solidity gravity motion and rest the argument naturally concentrates onextension and motion if things have real sizes says philonous the same thing cannot be ofdifferent sizes at the same time and yet it looks larger when we are near it than when we are faroff and if motion is really in the object how comes it that the same motion may seem fast to oneand slow to another such arguments must i think be allowed to prove the subjectivity ofperceived space but this subjectivity is physical it is equally true of a camera and therefore doesnot prove that shape is mental in the second dialogue philonous sums up the discussion so faras it has gone in the words besides spirits all that we know or conceive are our own ideas heought not of course to make an exception for spirits since it is just as impossible to know spiritas to know matter the arguments in fact are almost identical in both cases let us now try to state what positive conclusions we can reach as a result of the kind of argumentinaugurated by berkeley things as we know them are bundles of sensible qualities a table for example consists of itsvisual shape its hardness the noise it emits when rapped and its smell these differentqualities have certain contiguities in experience which lead common sense to regard them asbelonging to one thing but the concept of thing or substance adds nothing to the perceivedqualities and is unnecessary so far we are on firm ground but we must now ask ourselves what we mean by perceiving philonous maintains that asregards sensible things their reality consists in their being perceived but he does not tell us whathe means by perception there is a theory which he rejects that perception is a relation between asubject and a percept since he believed the ego to be a substance he might well have adopted thistheory however he decided against it for those who reject the notion of a substantial ego thistheory is impossible what then is meant by calling something a percept does it meananything more than that the something in question occurs can we turn berkeleys dictum roundand instead of saying that reality consists in being perceived say that being perceived consists inbeing real however this may be berkeley holds it logically possible that there should beunperceived things since he holds that some real things viz spiritual substances areunperceived and it seems obvious that when we say that an event is perceived we meansomething more than that it occurs what is this more one obvious difference between perceived and unperceived events is that theformer but not the latter can be remembered is there any other difference recollection is one of a whole genus of effects which are more or less peculiar to the phenomenathat we naturally call mental these effects are connected with habit a burnt child fears the firea burnt poker does not the physiologist however deals with habit and kindred matters as acharacteristic of nervous tissue and has no need to depart from a physicalist interpretation inphysicalist language we can say that an occurrence is perceived if it has effects of certain kindsin this sense we might almost say that a watercourse perceives the rain by which it is deepenedand that a river valley is a memory of former downpours habit and memory when described inphysicalist terms are not wholly absent in dead matter the difference in this respect betweenliving and dead matter is only one of degree in this view to say that an event is perceived is to say that it has effects of certain kinds andthere is no reason either logical or empirical for supposing that all events have effects of thesekinds theory of knowledge suggests a different standpoint we start here not from finished sciencebut from whatever knowledge is the ground for our belief in science this is what berkeley isdoing here it is not necessary in advance to define a percept the method in outline is asfollows we collect the propositions that we feel we know without inference and we find that most of these have to do with dated particular events these events we define as percepts percepts therefore are those events that we knowwithout inference or at least to allow for memory such events were at some time percepts weare then faced with the question can we from our own percepts infer any other events herefour positions are possible of which the first three are forms of idealism we may deny totally the validity of all inferences from my present percepts andmemories to other events this view must be taken by any one who confines inference todeduction any event and any group of events is logically capable of standing aloneand therefore no group of events affords demonstrative

isadmitted 
but we must now ask ourselves what we mean by perceiving philonous maintains that asregards sensible things their reality consists in their being perceived but he does not tell us whathe means by perception there is a theory which he rejects that perception is a relation between asubject and a percept since he believed the ego to be a substance he might well have adopted thistheory however he decided against it for those who reject the notion of a substantial ego thistheory is impossible what then is meant by calling something a percept does it meananything more than that the something in question occurs can we turn berkeleys dictum roundand instead of saying that reality consists in being perceived say that being perceived consists inbeing real however this may be berkeley holds it logically possible that there should beunperceived things since he holds that some real things viz spiritual substances areunperceived and it seems obvious that when we say that an event is perceived we meansomething more than that it occurs what is this more one obvious difference between perceived and unperceived events is that theformer but not the latter can be remembered is there any other difference recollection is one of a whole genus of effects which are more or less peculiar to the phenomenathat we naturally call mental these effects are connected with habit a burnt child fears the firea burnt poker does not the physiologist however deals with habit and kindred matters as acharacteristic of nervous tissue and has no need to depart from a physicalist interpretation inphysicalist language we can say that an occurrence is perceived if it has effects of certain kindsin this sense we might almost say that a watercourse perceives the rain by which it is deepenedand that a river valley is a memory of former downpours habit and memory when described inphysicalist terms are not wholly absent in dead matter the difference in this respect betweenliving and dead matter is only one of degree in this view to say that an event is perceived is to say that it has effects of certain kinds andthere is no reason either logical or empirical for supposing that all events have effects of thesekinds theory of knowledge suggests a different standpoint we start here not from finished sciencebut from whatever knowledge is the ground for our belief in science this is what berkeley isdoing here it is not necessary in advance to define a percept the method in outline is asfollows we collect the propositions that we feel we know without inference and we find that most of these have to do with dated particular events these events we define as percepts percepts therefore are those events that we knowwithout inference or at least to allow for memory such events were at some time percepts weare then faced with the question can we from our own percepts infer any other events herefour positions are possible of which the first three are forms of idealism we may deny totally the validity of all inferences from my present percepts andmemories to other events this view must be taken by any one who confines inference todeduction any event and any group of events is logically capable of standing aloneand therefore no group of events affords demonstrative proof of the existence of otherevents if therefore we confine inference to deduction the known world is confined tothose events in our own biography that we perceiveor have perceived if memory isadmitted the second position which is solipsism as ordinarily understood allows someinference from my percepts but only to other events in my own biography take forexample the view that at any moment in waking life there are sensible objects that wedo not notice we see many things without saying to ourselves that we see them at leastso it seems keeping the eyes fixed in an environment in which we perceive nomovement we can notice various things in succession and we feel persuaded that theywere visible before we noticed them but before we noticed them they were not data fortheory of knowledge this degree of inference from what we observe is madeunreflectingly by everybody even by those who most wish to avoid an undue extensionof our knowledge beyond experience the third positionwhich seems to be held for instance by eddingtonis that it ispossible to make inferences to other events analogous to those in our own experienceand that therefore we have a right to believe that there are for instance colours seen byother people but not by ourselves toothaches felt by other people pleasures enjoyed andpains endured by other people and so on but that we have no right to infer eventsexperienced by no one and not forming part of any mind this view may be defendedon the ground that all inference to events which lie outside my observation is by analogyand that events which no one experiences are not sufficiently analogous to my data to warrant analogical inferences the fourth position is that of common sense and traditional physics according towhich there are in addition to my own experiences and other peoples also events whichno one experiencesfor example the furniture of my bedroom when i am asleep and it ispitch dark g e moore once accused idealists of holding that trains only have wheelswhile they are in stations on the ground that passengers cannot see the wheels while theyremain in the train common sense refuses to believe that the wheels suddenly springinto being whenever you look but do not bother to exist when no one is inspecting them when this point of view is scientific it bases the inference to unperceived events oncausal laws

i do not propose at present to decide between these four points of view the decision ifpossible at all can only be made by an elaborate investigation of nondemonstrative inferenceand the theory of probability what i do propose to do is to point out certain logical errorswhich have been committed by those who have discussed these questions berkeley as we have seen thinks that there are logical reasons proving that only minds andmental events can exist this view on other grounds is also held by hegel and his followers ibelieve this to be a complete mistake such a statement as there was a time before life existedon this planet whether true or false cannot be condemned on grounds of logic any more thanthere are multiplication sums which no one will have ever worked out to be observed or tobe a percept is merely to have effects of certain kinds and there is no logical reason why allevents should have effects of these kinds there is however another kind of argument which while it does not establish idealism as ametaphysic does if valid establish it as a practical policy it is said that a proposition which isunverifiable has no meaning that verification depends upon percepts and that therefore aproposition about anything except actual or possible percepts is meaningless i think that thisview strictly interpreted would confine us to the first of the above four theories and wouldforbid us to speak about anything that we have not ourselves explicitly noticed if so it is aview that no one can hold in practice which is a defect in a theory that is advocated on practicalgrounds the whole question of verification and its connection with knowledge is difficult and complex i will therefore leave it on one side for the present the fourth of the above theorieswhich admits events that no one perceives may also be defended by invalid arguments it may beheld that causality is known a priori and that causal laws are impossible unless there areunperceived events as against this it may be urged that causality is not a priori and thatwhatever regularity can be observed must be in relation to percepts whatever there is reason tobelieve in the laws of physics must it would seem be capable of being stated in terms of percepts the statement may be odd and complicated it may lack the characteristic of continuity whichuntil lately was expected of a physical law but it can hardly be impossible i conclude that there is no a priori objection to any one of our four theories it is possiblehowever to say that all truth is pragmatic and that there is no pragmatic difference between thefour theories if this is true we can adopt whichever we please and the difference between them isonly linguistic i cannot accept this view but this also is a matter for discussion at a later stage it remains to be asked whether any meaning can be attached to the words mind and matterevery one knows that mind is what an idealist thinks there is nothing else but and matter iswhat a materialist thinks the same about the reader knows also i hope that idealists are virtuousand materialists are wicked but perhaps there may be more than this to be said my own definition of matter may seem unsatisfactory i should define it as what satisfies theequations of physics there may be nothing satisfying these equations in that case either physicsor the concept matter is a mistake if we reject substance matter will have to be a logicalconstruction whether it can be any construction composed of eventswhich may be partlyinferredis a difficult question but by no means an insoluble one as for mind when substance has been rejected a mind must be some group or structure ofevents the grouping must be effected by some relation which is characteristic of the sort ofphenomena we wish to call mental we may take memory as typical we mightthough thiswould be rather unduly simpledefine a mental event as one which remembers or isremembered then the mind to which a given mental event belongs is the group of eventsconnected with the given event by memorychains backwards or forwards 
complex i will therefore leave it on one side for the present the fourth of the above theorieswhich admits events that no one perceives may also be defended by invalid arguments it may beheld that causality is known a priori and that causal laws are impossible unless there areunperceived events as against this it may be urged that causality is not a priori and thatwhatever regularity can be observed must be in relation to percepts whatever there is reason tobelieve in the laws of physics must it would seem be capable of being stated in terms of percepts the statement may be odd and complicated it may lack the characteristic of continuity whichuntil lately was expected of a physical law but it can hardly be impossible i conclude that there is no a priori objection to any one of our four theories it is possiblehowever to say that all truth is pragmatic and that there is no pragmatic difference between thefour theories if this is true we can adopt whichever we please and the difference between them isonly linguistic i cannot accept this view but this also is a matter for discussion at a later stage it remains to be asked whether any meaning can be attached to the words mind and matterevery one knows that mind is what an idealist thinks there is nothing else but and matter iswhat a materialist thinks the same about the reader knows also i hope that idealists are virtuousand materialists are wicked but perhaps there may be more than this to be said my own definition of matter may seem unsatisfactory i should define it as what satisfies theequations of physics there may be nothing satisfying these equations in that case either physicsor the concept matter is a mistake if we reject substance matter will have to be a logicalconstruction whether it can be any construction composed of eventswhich may be partlyinferredis a difficult question but by no means an insoluble one as for mind when substance has been rejected a mind must be some group or structure ofevents the grouping must be effected by some relation which is characteristic of the sort ofphenomena we wish to call mental we may take memory as typical we mightthough thiswould be rather unduly simpledefine a mental event as one which remembers or isremembered then the mind to which a given mental event belongs is the group of eventsconnected with the given event by memorychains backwards or forwards it will be seen that according to the above definitions a mind and a piece of matter are each ofthem a group of events there is no reason why every event should belong to a group of one kindor the other and there is no reason why some events should not belong to both groups thereforesome events may be neither mental nor material and other events may be both as to this onlydetailed empirical considerations can decide chapter xvii hume david hume is one of the most important among philosophers because hedeveloped to its logical conclusion the empirical philosophy of locke and berkeley and bymaking it selfconsistent made it incredible he represents in a certain sense a dead end in hisdirection it is impossible to go further to refute him has been ever since he wrote a favouritepastime among metaphysicians for my part i find none of their refutations convincingnevertheless i cannot but hope that something less sceptical than humes system may bediscoverable his chief philosophical work the treatise of human nature was written while he was living in france during the years to the first two volumes were published in the third in he was a very young man not yet in his thirties he was not well known and hisconclusions were such as almost all schools would find unwelcome he hoped for vehementattacks which he would meet with brilliant retorts instead no one noticed the book as he sayshimself it fell deadborn from the press but he adds being naturally of a cheerful andsanguine temper i very soon recovered from the blow he devoted himself to the writing ofessays of which he produced the first volume in in he made an unsuccessful attemptto obtain a professorship at edinburgh having failed in this he became first tutor to a lunatic andthen secretary to a general

out introducing the self further the self as defined can be nothing but a bundle ofperceptions not a new simple thing in this i think that any thoroughgoing empiricist must agreewith hume it does not follow that there is no simple self it only follows that we cannot know whether thereis or not and that the self except as a bundle of perceptions cannot enter into any part of ourknowledge this conclusion is important in metaphysics as getting rid of the last surviving use ofsubstance it is important in theology as abolishing all supposed knowledge of the soul it isimportant in the analysis of knowledge since it shows that the category of subject and object isnot fundamental in this matter of the ego hume made an important advance on berkeley the most important part of the whole treatise is the section called of knowledge and probability hume does not mean by probability the sort of knowledge contained in themathematical theory of probability such as that the chance of throwing double sixes with two diceis one thirtysixth this knowledge is not itself probable in any special sense it has as muchcertainty as knowledge can have what hume is concerned with is uncertain knowledge such as isobtained from empirical data by inferences that are not demonstrative this includes all ourknowledge as to the future and as to unobserved portions of the past and present in fact itincludes everything except on the one hand direct observation and on the other logic andmathematics the analysis of such probable knowledge led hume to certain scepticalconclusions which are equally difficult to refute and to accept the result was a challenge tophilosophers which in my opinion has still not been adequately met hume begins by distinguishing seven kinds of philosophical relation resemblance identityrelations of time and place proportion in quantity or number degrees in any quality contrarietyand causation these he says may be divided into two kinds those that depend only on the ideasand those that can be changed without any change in the ideas of the first kind are resemblancecontrariety degrees in quality and proportions in quantity or number but spatiotemporal andcausal relations are of the second kind only relations of the first kind give certain knowledge ourknowledge concerning the others is only probable algebra and arithmetic are the only sciences inwhich we can carry on a long chain of reasoning without losing certainty geometry is not so certain as algebra and arithmetic because we cannot be sure of the truth of itsaxioms it is a mistake to suppose as many philosophers do that the ideas of mathematics mustbe comprehended by a pure and intellectual view of which the superior faculties of the soul arealone capable the falsehood of this view is evident says hume as soon as we remember thatall our ideas are copied from our impressions the three relations that depend not only on ideas are identity spatiotemporal relations andcausation in the first two the mind does not go beyond what is immediately present to the sensescausation alone enables us to infer some thing or occurrence from some other thing oroccurrence tis only causation which produces such a connexion as to give us assurance fromthe existence or action of one object that twas followed or preceded by any other existence oraction a difficulty arises from humes contention that there is no such thing as an impression of a causalrelation we can perceive by mere observation of a and b that a is above b or to the right of bbut not that a causes b in the past the relation of causation had been more or less assimilated tothat of ground and consequent in logic but this hume rightly perceived was a mistake in the cartesian philosophy as in that of the scholastics the connection of cause and effect wassupposed to be necessary as logical connections are necessary the first really serious challengeto this view came from hume with whom the modern philosophy of causation begins he incommon with almost all philosophers down to and including bergson supposes the law to statethat there are propositions of the form a causes b where a and b are classes of events the factthat such laws do not occur in any welldeveloped science appears to be unknown to philosophers but much of what they have said can be translated so as to be applicable to causal laws such as dooccur we may therefore ignore this point for the present hume begins by observing that the power by which one object produces another is notdiscoverable from the ideas of the two objects and that we can therefore only know cause andeffect from experience not from reasoning or reflection the statement what begins must have acause he says is not one that has intuitive certainty like 
geometry is not so certain as algebra and arithmetic because we cannot be sure of the truth of itsaxioms it is a mistake to suppose as many philosophers do that the ideas of mathematics mustbe comprehended by a pure and intellectual view of which the superior faculties of the soul arealone capable the falsehood of this view is evident says hume as soon as we remember thatall our ideas are copied from our impressions the three relations that depend not only on ideas are identity spatiotemporal relations andcausation in the first two the mind does not go beyond what is immediately present to the sensescausation alone enables us to infer some thing or occurrence from some other thing oroccurrence tis only causation which produces such a connexion as to give us assurance fromthe existence or action of one object that twas followed or preceded by any other existence oraction a difficulty arises from humes contention that there is no such thing as an impression of a causalrelation we can perceive by mere observation of a and b that a is above b or to the right of bbut not that a causes b in the past the relation of causation had been more or less assimilated tothat of ground and consequent in logic but this hume rightly perceived was a mistake in the cartesian philosophy as in that of the scholastics the connection of cause and effect wassupposed to be necessary as logical connections are necessary the first really serious challengeto this view came from hume with whom the modern philosophy of causation begins he incommon with almost all philosophers down to and including bergson supposes the law to statethat there are propositions of the form a causes b where a and b are classes of events the factthat such laws do not occur in any welldeveloped science appears to be unknown to philosophers but much of what they have said can be translated so as to be applicable to causal laws such as dooccur we may therefore ignore this point for the present hume begins by observing that the power by which one object produces another is notdiscoverable from the ideas of the two objects and that we can therefore only know cause andeffect from experience not from reasoning or reflection the statement what begins must have acause he says is not one that has intuitive certainty like the statements of logic as he puts it there is no object which implies the existence of any otherif we consider these objects in themselves and never look beyond the ideas which we form ofthem hume argues from this that it must be experience that gives knowledge of cause and effectbut that it cannot be merely the experience of the two events a and b which are in a causalrelation to each other it must be experience because the connection is not logical and it cannotbe merely the experience of the particular events a and b since we can discover nothing in a byitself which should lead it to produce b the experience required he says is that of the constantconjunction of events of the kind a with events of the kind b he points out that when inexperience two objects are constantly conjoined we do in fact infer one from the other perhaps the necessary connection depends on the inference notvice versa that is to say the sight of a causes the expectation of b and so leads us to believe thatthere is a necessary connection between a and b the inference is not determined by reason sincethat would require us to assume the uniformity of nature which itself is not necessary but onlyinferred from experience hume is thus led to the view that when we say a causes b we mean only that a and b areconstantly conjoined in fact not that there is some necessary connection between them we haveno other notion of cause and effect but that of certain objects which have been always conjoinedtogether  we cannot penetrate into the reason of the conjunction he backs up his theory with a definition of belief which is he maintains a lively idea relatedto or associated with a present impression through association if a and b have been constantlyconjoined in past experience the impression of a produces that lively idea of b which constitutesbelief in b this explains why we believe a and b to be connected the percept of a is connectedwith the idea of b and so we come to think that a is connected with b though this opinion isreally groundless objects have no discoverable connexion together nor is it from any otherprinciple but custom operating upon the imagination that we can draw any inference from theappearance of one to the experience of another he repeats many 
the statements of logic as he puts it there is no object which implies the existence of any otherif we consider these objects in themselves and never look beyond the ideas which we form ofthem hume argues from this that it must be experience that gives knowledge of cause and effectbut that it cannot be merely the experience of the two events a and b which are in a causalrelation to each other it must be experience because the connection is not logical and it cannotbe merely the experience of the particular events a and b since we can discover nothing in a byitself which should lead it to produce b the experience required he says is that of the constantconjunction of events of the kind a with events of the kind b he points out that when inexperience two objects are constantly conjoined we do in fact infer one from the other perhaps the necessary connection depends on the inference notvice versa that is to say the sight of a causes the expectation of b and so leads us to believe thatthere is a necessary connection between a and b the inference is not determined by reason sincethat would require us to assume the uniformity of nature which itself is not necessary but onlyinferred from experience hume is thus led to the view that when we say a causes b we mean only that a and b areconstantly conjoined in fact not that there is some necessary connection between them we haveno other notion of cause and effect but that of certain objects which have been always conjoinedtogether  we cannot penetrate into the reason of the conjunction he backs up his theory with a definition of belief which is he maintains a lively idea relatedto or associated with a present impression through association if a and b have been constantlyconjoined in past experience the impression of a produces that lively idea of b which constitutesbelief in b this explains why we believe a and b to be connected the percept of a is connectedwith the idea of b and so we come to think that a is connected with b though this opinion isreally groundless objects have no discoverable connexion together nor is it from any otherprinciple but custom operating upon the imagination that we can draw any inference from theappearance of one to the experience of another he repeats many times the contention that what appears to us as necessary connection among objects is really onlyconnection among the ideas of those objects the mind is determined by custom and tis thisimpression or determination which affords me the idea of necessity the repetition of instanceswhich leads us to the belief that a causes b gives nothing new in the object but in the mind leadsto an association of ideas thus necessity is something that exists in the mind not in objects let us now ask ourselves what we are to think of humes doctrine it has two parts one objectivethe other subjective the objective part says when we judge that a causes b what has in facthappened so far as a and b are concerned is that they have been frequently observed to beconjoined ie a has been immediately or very quickly followed by b we have no right to saythat a must be followed by b or will be followed by b on future occasions nor have we anyground for supposing that however often a is followed by b any relation beyond sequence isinvolved in fact causation is definable in terms of sequence and is not an independent notion the subjective part of the doctrine says the frequently observed conjunction of a and b causesthe impression of a to cause the idea of b but if we are to define cause as is suggested in theobjective part of the doctrine we must reword the above substituting the definition of causethe above becomes it has been frequently observed that the frequently observed conjunction of two objects a and bhas been frequently followed by occasions on which the impression of a was followed by the ideaof b this statement we may admit is true but it has hardly the scope that hume attributes to thesubjective part of his doctrine he contends over and over again that the frequent conjunction of a and b gives no reason for expecting them to be conjoined in the future but is merely a cause ofthis expectation that is to say experience of frequent conjunction is frequently conjoined with ahabit of association but if the objective part of humes doctrine is accepted the fact that in thepast associations have been frequently formed in such circumstances is no reason for supposingthat they will continue or that new ones will be formed in similar circumstances the fact is thatwhere psychology is concerned hume allows himself to 
times the contention that what appears to us as necessary connection among objects is really onlyconnection among the ideas of those objects the mind is determined by custom and tis thisimpression or determination which affords me the idea of necessity the repetition of instanceswhich leads us to the belief that a causes b gives nothing new in the object but in the mind leadsto an association of ideas thus necessity is something that exists in the mind not in objects let us now ask ourselves what we are to think of humes doctrine it has two parts one objectivethe other subjective the objective part says when we judge that a causes b what has in facthappened so far as a and b are concerned is that they have been frequently observed to beconjoined ie a has been immediately or very quickly followed by b we have no right to saythat a must be followed by b or will be followed by b on future occasions nor have we anyground for supposing that however often a is followed by b any relation beyond sequence isinvolved in fact causation is definable in terms of sequence and is not an independent notion the subjective part of the doctrine says the frequently observed conjunction of a and b causesthe impression of a to cause the idea of b but if we are to define cause as is suggested in theobjective part of the doctrine we must reword the above substituting the definition of causethe above becomes it has been frequently observed that the frequently observed conjunction of two objects a and bhas been frequently followed by occasions on which the impression of a was followed by the ideaof b this statement we may admit is true but it has hardly the scope that hume attributes to thesubjective part of his doctrine he contends over and over again that the frequent conjunction of a and b gives no reason for expecting them to be conjoined in the future but is merely a cause ofthis expectation that is to say experience of frequent conjunction is frequently conjoined with ahabit of association but if the objective part of humes doctrine is accepted the fact that in thepast associations have been frequently formed in such circumstances is no reason for supposingthat they will continue or that new ones will be formed in similar circumstances the fact is thatwhere psychology is concerned hume allows himself to believe in causation in a sense which in general he condemns let us take an illustration i see anapple and expect that if i eat it i shall experience a certain kind of taste according to humethere is no reason why i should experience this kind of taste the law of habit explains theexistence of my expectation but does not justify it but the law of habit is itself a causal law therefore if we take hume seriously we must say although in the past the sight of an apple hasbeen conjoined with expectation of a certain kind of taste there is no reason why it shouldcontinue to be so conjoined perhaps the next time i see an apple i shall expect it to taste like roastbeef you may at the moment think this unlikely but that is no reason for expecting that you willthink it unlikely five minutes hence if humes objective doctrine is right we have no betterreason for expectations in psychology than in the physical world humes theory might becaricatured as follows the proposition a causes b means the impression of a causes the ideaof b as a definition this is not a happy effort we must therefore examine humes objective doctrine more closely this doctrine has two parts when we say a causes b all that we have a right to say is that in past experience a and bhave frequently appeared together or in rapid succession and no instance has been observed of anot followed or accompanied by b however many instances we may have observed of theconjunction of a and b that gives no reason for expecting them to be conjoined on a futureoccasion though it is a cause of this expectation ie it has been frequently observed to beconjoined with such an expectation these two parts of the doctrine may be stated as follows in causation there is no indefinable relation except conjunction or succession induction bysimple enumeration is not a valid form of argument empiricists in general have accepted the firstof these theses and rejected the second when i say they have rejected the second i mean that theyhave believed that given a sufficiently vast accumulation of instances of a conjunction thelikelihood of the conjunction being found in the next instance will exceed a half or if they havenot held exactly this they have maintained some doctrine having similar consequences i do not wish at the moment to discuss induction which is a large and difficult subject for themoment i am content to observe that if the first half of humes doctrine is admitted the rejectionof induc

as an argument this seems invalid we believe in many relations of time and place which wecannot perceive we think that time extends backwards and forwards and space beyond the wallsof our room humes real argument is that while we sometimes perceive relations of time andplace we never perceive causal relations which must therefore if admitted be inferred fromrelations that can be perceived the controversy is thus reduced to one of empirical fact do we ordo we not sometimes perceive a relation which can be called causal hume says no hisadversaries say yes and it is not easy to see how evidence can be produced by either side i think perhaps the strongest argument on humes side is to be derived from the character ofcausal laws in physics it appears that simple rules of the form a causes b are never to beadmitted in science except as crude suggestions in early stages the causal laws by which suchsimple rules are replaced in welldeveloped sciences are so complex that no one can suppose themgiven in perception they are all obviously elaborate inferences from the observed course ofnature i am leaving out of account modern quantum theory which reinforces the aboveconclusion so far as the physical sciences are concerned hume is wholly in the right suchpropositions as a causes b are never to be accepted and our inclination to accept them is to beexplained by the laws of habit and association these laws themselves in their accurate form willbe elaborate statements as to nervous tissueprimarily its physiology then its chemistry andultimately its physics the opponent of hume however even if he admits the whole of what has just been said about thephysical sciences may not yet admit himself decisively defeated he may say that in psychologywe have cases where a causal relation can be perceived the whole conception of cause isprobably derived from volition and it may be said that we can perceive a relation between avolition and the consequent act which is something more than invariable sequence the samemight be said of the relation between a sudden pain and a cry such views however are renderedvery difficult by physiology between the will to move my arm and the consequent movementthere is a long chain of causal intermediaries consisting of processes in the nerves and muscles we perceive only the end terms of this process the volition and the movement and if we think wesee a direct causal connection between these we are mistaken this argument is not conclusive on the generalquestion but it shows that it is rash to suppose that we perceive causal relations when we thinkwe do the balance therefore is in favour of humes view that there is nothing in cause exceptinvariable succession the evidence however is not so conclusive as hume supposed hume is not content with reducing the evidence of a causal connection to experience offrequent conjunction he proceeds to argue that such experience does not justify the expectationof similar conjunctions in the future for example when i see anapple past experience makes me expect that it win taste like an apple and not like roast beefbut there is no rational justification for this expectation if there were such a justification itwould have to proceed from the principle that those instances of which we have had noexperience resemble those of which we have had experience this principle is not logicallynecessary since we can at least conceive a change in the course of nature it should therefore bea principle of probability but all probable arguments assume this principle and therefore itcannot itself be proved by any probable argument or even rendered probable by any suchargument the supposition that the future resembles the past is not founded on arguments ofany kind but is derived entirely from habit the conclusion is one of complete scepticism all probable reasoning is nothing but a species of sensation tis not solely in poetry andmusic we must follow our taste and sentiment but likewise in philosophy when i amconvinced of any principle tis only an idea which strikes more strongly upon me when i givethe preference to one set of arguments above another i do nothing but decide from my feelingconcerning the superiority of their influence objects have no discoverable connexion togethernor is it from any other principle but custom operating upon the imagination that we can drawany inference from the appearance of one to the existence of another the ultimate outcome of humes investigation of what passes for knowledge is not what wemust suppose him to have desired the subtitle of his book is an attempt to introduce theexperimental  book i part iii sec iv book i part iii sec viii 
connection between these we are mistaken this argument is not conclusive on the generalquestion but it shows that it is rash to suppose that we perceive causal relations when we thinkwe do the balance therefore is in favour of humes view that there is nothing in cause exceptinvariable succession the evidence however is not so conclusive as hume supposed hume is not content with reducing the evidence of a causal connection to experience offrequent conjunction he proceeds to argue that such experience does not justify the expectationof similar conjunctions in the future for example when i see anapple past experience makes me expect that it win taste like an apple and not like roast beefbut there is no rational justification for this expectation if there were such a justification itwould have to proceed from the principle that those instances of which we have had noexperience resemble those of which we have had experience this principle is not logicallynecessary since we can at least conceive a change in the course of nature it should therefore bea principle of probability but all probable arguments assume this principle and therefore itcannot itself be proved by any probable argument or even rendered probable by any suchargument the supposition that the future resembles the past is not founded on arguments ofany kind but is derived entirely from habit the conclusion is one of complete scepticism all probable reasoning is nothing but a species of sensation tis not solely in poetry andmusic we must follow our taste and sentiment but likewise in philosophy when i amconvinced of any principle tis only an idea which strikes more strongly upon me when i givethe preference to one set of arguments above another i do nothing but decide from my feelingconcerning the superiority of their influence objects have no discoverable connexion togethernor is it from any other principle but custom operating upon the imagination that we can drawany inference from the appearance of one to the existence of another the ultimate outcome of humes investigation of what passes for knowledge is not what wemust suppose him to have desired the subtitle of his book is an attempt to introduce theexperimental  book i part iii sec iv book i part iii sec viii method of reasoning into moral subjects it is evident that he started out with a belief thatscientific method yields the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth he ended howeverwith the conviction that belief is never rational since we know nothing after setting forth thearguments for scepticism he goes on not to refute the arguments but tofall back on natural credulity nature by an absolute and uncontrollable necessity has determined us to judge as well as tobreathe and feel nor can we any more forbear viewing certain objects in a stronger and fullerlight upon account of their customary connexion with a present impression than we can hinderourselves from thinking as long as we are awake or seeing the surrounding bodies when we turnour eyes towards them in broad sunshine whoever has taken the pains to refute this totalscepticism has really disputed without an antagonist and endeavoured by arguments to establish afaculty which nature has antecedently implanted in the mind and rendered unavoidable myintention then in displaying so carefully the arguments of that fantastic sect is only to make thereader sensible of the truth of my hypothesis that all our reasonings concerning causes andeffects are derived from nothing but custom and that belief is more properly an act of thesensitive than of the cogitative part of our natures the sceptic he continues still continues to reason and believe eventhough he asserts that he cannot defend his reason by reason and by the same rule he must assentto the principle concerning the existence of body tho he cannot pretend by any arguments ofphilosophy to maintain its veracity  we may well ask what causes us to believe in theexistence of body but tis vain to ask whether there be body or not that is a point which wemust take for granted in all our reasonings the above is the beginning of a section of scepticism with regard to the senses after a longdiscussion this section ends with the following conclusion this sceptical doubt both with respect to reason and the senses is a malady which can never beradically cured but must return upon us every moment however we may chase it away andsometimes may seem entirely free from it  carelessness and inattention alone can afford usany remedy for this reason i rely entirely

we feel to be employing ourselves after thatmanner if he abandoned speculation i feel i should be a loser in point of pleasure and this isthe origin of my philosophy humes philosophy whether true or false represents the bankruptcy of eighteenthcenturyreasonableness he starts out like locke with the intention of being sensible and empiricaltaking nothing on trust but seeking whatever instruction is to be obtained from experience andobservation but having a better intellect than lockes a greater acuteness in analysis and asmaller capacity for accepting comfortable inconsistencies he arrives at the disastrous conclusionthat from experience and observation nothing is to be learnt there is no such thing as a rationalbelief if we believe that fire warms or water refreshes tis only because it costs us too muchpains to think otherwise we cannot help believing but no belief can be grounded in reason norcan one line of action be more rational than another since all alike are based upon irrationalconvictions this last conclusion however hume seems not to have drawn even in his mostsceptical chapter in which he sums up the conclusions of book i he says generally speakingthe errors in religion are dangerous those in philosophy only ridiculous he has no right to saythis dangerous is a causal word and a sceptic as to causation cannot know that anything isdangerous in fact in the later portions of the treatise hume forgets all about his fundamental doubts andwrites much as any other enlightened moralist of his time might have written he applies to hisdoubts the remedy that he

outlook chiefly in matters not definitely philosophical for this is the culturalbackground of most philosophic thought in the period with which we are now to be concerned the romantic movement was not in its beginnings connected with philosophy though it camebefore long to have connections with it with politics through rousseau it was connected fromthe first but before we can understand its political and philosophical effects we must consider itin its most essential form which is as a revolt against received ethical and aesthetic standards the first great figure in the movement is rousseau but to some extent he only expressed alreadyexisting tendencies cultivated people in eighteenthcentury france greatly admired what theycalled la sensibilit which meant a proneness to emotion and more particularly to the emotionof sympathy to be thoroughly satisfactory the emotion must be direct and violent and quiteuninformed by thought

the romantics were not without morals on the contrary their moral judgements were sharp andvehement but they were based on quite other principles than those that had seemed good to theirpredecessors the period from to rousseau is dominated by recollections of the wars ofreligion and the civil wars in france and england and germany men were very conscious of thedanger of chaos of the anarchic tendencies of all strong passions of the importance of safety andthe sacrifices necessary to achieve it prudence was regarded as the supreme virtue intellect wasvalued as the most effective weapon against subversive fanatics polished manners were praised asa barrier against barbarism newtons orderly cosmos in which the planets unchangingly revolveabout the sun in lawabiding orbits became an imaginative symbol of good government restraintin the expression of passion was the chief aim of education and the surest mark of a gentleman inthe revolution preromantic french aristocrats died quietly madame roland and danton whowere romantics died rhetorically by the time of rousseau many people had grown tired of safety and had begun to desireexcitement the french revolution and napoleon gave them their fill of it when in thepolitical world returned to tranquillity it was a tranquillity so dead so rigid so hostile to allvigorous life that only terrified conservatives could endure it consequently there was no suchintellectual acquiescence in the status quo as had characterized france under the roi soleil and england until the french revolution nineteenthcentury revolt against the system of the holy alliance took two forms on the one hand there was the revolt of industrialism both capitalistand proletarian against monarchy and aristocracy this was almost untouched by romanticism andreverted in many respects to the eighteenth century this movement is represented by thephilosophical radicals the freetrade movement and marxian socialism quite different from thiswas the romantic revolt which was in part reactionary in part revolutionary the romantics didnot aim at peace and quiet but at vigorous and passionate individual life they had no sympathywith industrialism because it was ugly because moneygrubbing seemed to them unworthy of animmortal soul and because the growth of modern economic organizations interfered withindividual liberty in the postrevolutionary period they were led into politics gradually through nationalism each nation was felt to have a corporate soul which could not be free so longas the boundaries of states were different from those of nations in the first half of the nineteenthcentury nationalism was the most vigorous of revolutionary principles and most romanticsardently favoured it the romantic movement is characterized as a whole by the substitution of aesthetic for utilitarianstandards the earthworm is useful but not beautiful the tiger is beautiful but not useful darwin praised the earthworm blake praised the tiger the morals ofthe romantics have primarily aesthetic motives but in order to characterize the romantics it isnecessary to take account not only of the importance of aesthetic motives but also of the changeof taste which made their sense of beauty different from that of their predecessors of this theirpreference for gothic architecture is one of the most obvious examples another is their taste inscenery dr johnson preferred fleet street to any rural landscape and maintained that a man whois tired of london must be tired of life if anything in the country was admired by rousseauspredecessors it was a scene of fertility with rich pastures and lowing kine rousseau being swiss naturally admired the alps in his disciples novels and stories we find wild torrentsfearful precipices pathless forests thunderstorms tempests at sea and generally what is uselessdestructive and violent this change seems to be more or less permanent almost everybodynowadays prefers niagara and the grand canyon to lush meadows and fields of waving corn tourist hotels afford statistical evidence of taste in scenery the temper of the romantics is best studied in fiction they liked what was strange ghostsancient decayed castles the last melancholy descendants of oncegreat families practitioners ofmesmerism and the occult sciences falling tyrants and levantine pirates fielding and smollettwrote of ordinary people in circumstances that might well have occurred so did the realists whoreacted against romanticism but to the romantics such themes were too pedestrian they feltinspired only by what was grand remote and terrifying science of a somewhat dubious sortcould be utilized if it led to something astonishing but in the main the middle ages and whatwas most medieval in the present pleased the romantics best very often they cut loose fromactuality either past or present altogether the ancient mariner 
through nationalism each nation was felt to have a corporate soul which could not be free so longas the boundaries of states were different from those of nations in the first half of the nineteenthcentury nationalism was the most vigorous of revolutionary principles and most romanticsardently favoured it the romantic movement is characterized as a whole by the substitution of aesthetic for utilitarianstandards the earthworm is useful but not beautiful the tiger is beautiful but not useful darwin praised the earthworm blake praised the tiger the morals ofthe romantics have primarily aesthetic motives but in order to characterize the romantics it isnecessary to take account not only of the importance of aesthetic motives but also of the changeof taste which made their sense of beauty different from that of their predecessors of this theirpreference for gothic architecture is one of the most obvious examples another is their taste inscenery dr johnson preferred fleet street to any rural landscape and maintained that a man whois tired of london must be tired of life if anything in the country was admired by rousseauspredecessors it was a scene of fertility with rich pastures and lowing kine rousseau being swiss naturally admired the alps in his disciples novels and stories we find wild torrentsfearful precipices pathless forests thunderstorms tempests at sea and generally what is uselessdestructive and violent this change seems to be more or less permanent almost everybodynowadays prefers niagara and the grand canyon to lush meadows and fields of waving corn tourist hotels afford statistical evidence of taste in scenery the temper of the romantics is best studied in fiction they liked what was strange ghostsancient decayed castles the last melancholy descendants of oncegreat families practitioners ofmesmerism and the occult sciences falling tyrants and levantine pirates fielding and smollettwrote of ordinary people in circumstances that might well have occurred so did the realists whoreacted against romanticism but to the romantics such themes were too pedestrian they feltinspired only by what was grand remote and terrifying science of a somewhat dubious sortcould be utilized if it led to something astonishing but in the main the middle ages and whatwas most medieval in the present pleased the romantics best very often they cut loose fromactuality either past or present altogether the ancient mariner is typical in this respect and coleridge kubla khan is hardly the historical monarch of marco polo the geography of the romantics is interesting from xanadu to the lone chorasmian shorethe places in which it is interested are remote asiatic or ancient the romantic movement in spite of owing its origin to rousseau was at first mainly german the german romantics were young in the last years of the eighteenth century and it was while theywere young that they gave expression to what was most characteristic in their outlook those whohad not the good fortune to die young in the end allowed their individuality to be obscured in theuniformity of the catholic church the german romantics influenced coleridge and shelley andindependently of german influence the same outlook became common in england during the earlyyears of the nineteenth century in france though in a weakened form it flourished after the restoration down to victor hugo in america it is to be seen almost pure in melville thoreauand brook farm and somewhat softened in emerson and hawthorne although romanticstended towards catholicism there was something ineradicably protestant in the individualism oftheir outlook and their permanent successes in moulding customs opinions and institutions werealmost wholly confined to protestant countries the beginnings of romanticism in england can be seen in the writings of the satirists in sheridan rivals the heroine is determined to marry some poor man for love rather than a rich manto please her guardian and his parents but the rich man whom they have selected wins her love bywooing her under an assumed name and pretending to be poor jane austen makes fun of theromantics in northanger abbey and sense and sensibility northanger abbey has aheroine who is led astray by mrs radcliffes ultraromantic mysteries of udolpho which waspublished in the first good romantic work in englandapart from blake who was a solitary swedenborgian and hardly part of any movementwas coleridge ancient mariner published in in the following year having unfortunately been supplied with funds by the wedgwoods hewent to gttingen and became engulfed in kant which did not improve his verse 
is typical in this respect and coleridge kubla khan is hardly the historical monarch of marco polo the geography of the romantics is interesting from xanadu to the lone chorasmian shorethe places in which it is interested are remote asiatic or ancient the romantic movement in spite of owing its origin to rousseau was at first mainly german the german romantics were young in the last years of the eighteenth century and it was while theywere young that they gave expression to what was most characteristic in their outlook those whohad not the good fortune to die young in the end allowed their individuality to be obscured in theuniformity of the catholic church the german romantics influenced coleridge and shelley andindependently of german influence the same outlook became common in england during the earlyyears of the nineteenth century in france though in a weakened form it flourished after the restoration down to victor hugo in america it is to be seen almost pure in melville thoreauand brook farm and somewhat softened in emerson and hawthorne although romanticstended towards catholicism there was something ineradicably protestant in the individualism oftheir outlook and their permanent successes in moulding customs opinions and institutions werealmost wholly confined to protestant countries the beginnings of romanticism in england can be seen in the writings of the satirists in sheridan rivals the heroine is determined to marry some poor man for love rather than a rich manto please her guardian and his parents but the rich man whom they have selected wins her love bywooing her under an assumed name and pretending to be poor jane austen makes fun of theromantics in northanger abbey and sense and sensibility northanger abbey has aheroine who is led astray by mrs radcliffes ultraromantic mysteries of udolpho which waspublished in the first good romantic work in englandapart from blake who was a solitary swedenborgian and hardly part of any movementwas coleridge ancient mariner published in in the following year having unfortunately been supplied with funds by the wedgwoods hewent to gttingen and became engulfed in kant which did not improve his verse after coleridge wordsworth and southey had become reactionaries hatred of the revolutionand napoleon put a temporary brake on english romanticism but it was soon revived by byron shelley and keats and in some degree dominated the whole victorian epoch mary shelley frankenstein written under the inspiration of conversations with byron in theromantic scenery of the alps contains what might almost be regarded as an allegorical prophetichistory of the development of romanticism frankensteins monster is not as he has become inproverbial parlance a mere monster he is at first a gentle being longing for human affectionbut he is driven to hatred and violence by the horror which his ugliness inspires in those whoselove he attempts to gain unseen he observes a virtuous family of poor cottagers andsurreptitiously assists their labours at length he decides to make himself known to them the more i saw of them the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness myheart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures to see their sweet looks directedtowards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition i dared not think that they wouldturn from me with disdain and horror but they did so he first demanded of his creator the creation of a female like himself and whenthat was refused devoted himself to murdering one by one all whom frankenstein loved buteven then when all his murders are accomplished and while he is gazing upon the dead body of frankenstein the monsters sentiments remain noble that also is my victim in his murder my crimes are consummated the miserable genius of mybeing is wound to its close oh frankenstein generous and selfdevoted being what does itavail that i now ask thee to pardon me i who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thatthou lovedst alas he is cold he cannot answer me  when i run over the frightful catalogue ofmy sins i cannot believe that i am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled withsublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness but it is even so thefallen angel becomes a malignant devil yet even that enemy of god and man had friends andassociates in his desolation i am alone robbed of its romantic form there is nothing unreal in this psychology and it is unnecessary tosearch out pirates or vandal kings 
after coleridge wordsworth and southey had become reactionaries hatred of the revolutionand napoleon put a temporary brake on english romanticism but it was soon revived by byron shelley and keats and in some degree dominated the whole victorian epoch mary shelley frankenstein written under the inspiration of conversations with byron in theromantic scenery of the alps contains what might almost be regarded as an allegorical prophetichistory of the development of romanticism frankensteins monster is not as he has become inproverbial parlance a mere monster he is at first a gentle being longing for human affectionbut he is driven to hatred and violence by the horror which his ugliness inspires in those whoselove he attempts to gain unseen he observes a virtuous family of poor cottagers andsurreptitiously assists their labours at length he decides to make himself known to them the more i saw of them the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness myheart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures to see their sweet looks directedtowards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition i dared not think that they wouldturn from me with disdain and horror but they did so he first demanded of his creator the creation of a female like himself and whenthat was refused devoted himself to murdering one by one all whom frankenstein loved buteven then when all his murders are accomplished and while he is gazing upon the dead body of frankenstein the monsters sentiments remain noble that also is my victim in his murder my crimes are consummated the miserable genius of mybeing is wound to its close oh frankenstein generous and selfdevoted being what does itavail that i now ask thee to pardon me i who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thatthou lovedst alas he is cold he cannot answer me  when i run over the frightful catalogue ofmy sins i cannot believe that i am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled withsublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness but it is even so thefallen angel becomes a malignant devil yet even that enemy of god and man had friends andassociates in his desolation i am alone robbed of its romantic form there is nothing unreal in this psychology and it is unnecessary tosearch out pirates or vandal kings in order to find parallels to an english visitor the ex kaiser at doorn lamented that the englishno longer loved him dr burt in his book on the juvenile delinquent mentions a boy of sevenwho drowned another boy in the regents canal his reason was that neither his family nor hiscontemporaries showed him affection dr burt was kind to him and he became a respectablecitizen but no dr burt undertook the reformation of frankensteins monster it is not the psychology of the romantics that is at fault it is their standard of values they admirestrong passions of no matter what kind and whatever may be their social consequences romantic love especially when unfortunate is strong enough to win their approval but most ofthe strongest passions are destructivehate and resentment and jealousy remorse and despairoutraged pride and the fury of the unjustly oppressed martial ardour and contempt for slaves andcowards hence the type of man encouraged by romanticism especially of the byronic variety isviolent and antisocial an anarchic rebel or a conquering tyrant this outlook makes an appeal for which the reasons lie very deep in human nature and humancircumstances by selfinterest man has become gregarious but in instinct he has remained to agreat extent solitary hence the need of religion and morality to reinforce selfinterest but the habitof forgoing present satisfactions for the sake of future advantages is irksome and when passionsare roused the prudent restraints of social behaviour become difficult to endure those who atsuch times throw them off acquire a new energy and sense of power from the cessation of innerconflict and though they may come to disaster in the end enjoy meanwhile a sense of godlikeexaltation which though known to the great mystics can never be experienced by a merelypedestrian virtue the solitary part of their nature reasserts itself but if the intellect survives thereassertion must clothe itself in myth the mystic becomes one with god and in thecontemplation of the infinite feels himself absolved from duty to his neighbour the anarchicrebel does even better he feels himself not one with god but god truth and duty whichrepresent our subjection to matter and to our neighbours exist no longer for the man who hasbecome god for others truth is what he posits duty what he commands if we could all livesolitary and without labour 
in order to find parallels to an english visitor the ex kaiser at doorn lamented that the englishno longer loved him dr burt in his book on the juvenile delinquent mentions a boy of sevenwho drowned another boy in the regents canal his reason was that neither his family nor hiscontemporaries showed him affection dr burt was kind to him and he became a respectablecitizen but no dr burt undertook the reformation of frankensteins monster it is not the psychology of the romantics that is at fault it is their standard of values they admirestrong passions of no matter what kind and whatever may be their social consequences romantic love especially when unfortunate is strong enough to win their approval but most ofthe strongest passions are destructivehate and resentment and jealousy remorse and despairoutraged pride and the fury of the unjustly oppressed martial ardour and contempt for slaves andcowards hence the type of man encouraged by romanticism especially of the byronic variety isviolent and antisocial an anarchic rebel or a conquering tyrant this outlook makes an appeal for which the reasons lie very deep in human nature and humancircumstances by selfinterest man has become gregarious but in instinct he has remained to agreat extent solitary hence the need of religion and morality to reinforce selfinterest but the habitof forgoing present satisfactions for the sake of future advantages is irksome and when passionsare roused the prudent restraints of social behaviour become difficult to endure those who atsuch times throw them off acquire a new energy and sense of power from the cessation of innerconflict and though they may come to disaster in the end enjoy meanwhile a sense of godlikeexaltation which though known to the great mystics can never be experienced by a merelypedestrian virtue the solitary part of their nature reasserts itself but if the intellect survives thereassertion must clothe itself in myth the mystic becomes one with god and in thecontemplation of the infinite feels himself absolved from duty to his neighbour the anarchicrebel does even better he feels himself not one with god but god truth and duty whichrepresent our subjection to matter and to our neighbours exist no longer for the man who hasbecome god for others truth is what he posits duty what he commands if we could all livesolitary and without labour we could all enjoy this ecstasy of independence since we cannot its delights are only available tomadmen and dictators revolt of solitary instincts against social bonds is the key to the philosophy the politics and thesentiments not only of what is commonly called the romantic movement but of its progeny downto the present day philosophy under the influence of german idealism became solipsistic andselfdevelopment was proclaimed as the fundamental principle of ethics as regards sentimentthere has to be a distasteful compromise between the search for isolation and the necessities ofpassion and economics d h lawrence story the man who loved islands has a hero whodisdained such compromise to a gradually increasing extent and at last died of hunger and coldbut in the enjoyment of complete isolation but this degree of consistency has not been achievedby the writers who praise solitude the comforts of civilized life are not obtainable by a hermitand a man who wishes to write books or produce works of art must submit to the ministrations ofothers if he is to survive while he does his work in order to continue to feel solitary he must beable to prevent those who serve him from impinging upon his ego which is best accomplished ifthey are slaves passionate love however is a more difficult matter so long as passionate loversare regarded as in revolt against social tranunels they are admired but in real life the loverelationitself quickly becomes a social trammel and the partner in love comes to be hated all the morevehemently if the love is strong enough to make the bond difficult to break hence love comes tobe conceived as a battle in which each is attempting to destroy the other by breaking through theprotecting walls of his or her ego this point of view has become familiar through the writing of strindberg and still more of d h lawrence not only passionate love but every friendly relation to others is only possible to this way offeeling in so far as the others can be regarded as a projection of ones own self this is feasible ifthe others are bloodrelations and the more nearly they are related the more easily it is possible hence an emphasis on race leading as in the case of the ptolemys to endogamy how thisaffected byron we know wagner suggests a similar sentiment in the love of siegmund and sieglinde nietzsche though not scandalously preferred his sister to all other women howstrongly i feel he writes to her in all

jective fact upon the emotions of the heart one is that there is no reason whatever to suppose thatsuch beliefs will be true the other is that the resulting beliefs will be private since the heart saysdif ferent things to different people some savages are persuaded by the natural light that it is theirduty to eat people and even voltaires savages who are led by the voice of reason to hold that oneshould only eat jesuits are not wholly satisfactory to buddhists the light of nature does notreveal the existence of god but does proclaim that it is wrong to eat the flesh of animals buteven if the heart said the same thing to all men that could afford no evidence for the existence ofanything outside our own emotions however ardently i or all mankind may desire somethinghowever necessary it may be to human happiness that is no ground for supposing this somethingto exist there is no law of nature guaranteeing that mankind should be happy everybody can seethat this is true of our life here on earth but by a curious twist our very sufferings in this life aremade into an argument for a better life hereafter we should not employ such an argument in anyother connection if you had bought ten dozen eggs from a man and the first dozen were allrotten you would not infer that the remaining nine dozen must be of surpassing excellence yetthat is the kind of reasoning that the heart encourages as a consolation for our sufferings herebelow for my part i prefer the ontological argument the cosmological argument and the rest of the oldstockintrade to the sentimental illogicality that has sprung from rousseau the old arguments atleast were honest if valid they proved their point if invalid it was open to any critic to provethem so but the new theology of the heart dispenses with argument it cannot be refuted becauseit does not profess to prove its points at bottom the only reason offered for its acceptance is thatit allows us to indulge in pleasant dreams this is an unworthy reason and if i had to choosebetween thomas aquinas and rousseau i should unhesitatingly choose the saint rousseau political theory is set forth in his social contract published in this book is verydifferent in character from most of his writing it contains little sentimentality and much closeintellectual reasoning its doctrines though they pay lipservice to democracy tend to thejustification of the totalitarian state but geneva and antiquity combined to make him prefer the city state to large empires such as those of france and england on the titlepage he calls himself citizen of geneva and inhis introductory sentences he says as i was born a citizen of a free state and a member of the sovereign i feel that however feeble the influence of my voice may have been on public affairsthe right of voting on them makes it my duty to study them there are frequent laudatoryreferences to sparta as it appears in plutarch life of lycurgus he says that democracy is best insmall states aristocracy in middlesized ones and monarchy in large ones but it is to beunderstood that in his opinion small states are preferable in part because they make democracymore practicable when he speaks of democracy he means as the greeks meant directparticipation of every citizen representative government he calls elective aristocracy since theformer is not possible in a large state his praise of democracy always implies praise of the city state this love of the city state is in my opinion not sufficiently emphasized in most accountsof rousseaus political philosophy although the book as a whole is much less rhetorical than most of rousseaus writing the firstchapter opens with a very forceful piece of rhetoric man is born free and everywhere he is inchains one man thinks himself the master of others but remains more of a slave than they areliberty is the nominal goal of rousseaus thought but in fact it is equality that he values and thathe seeks to secure even at the expense of liberty his conception of the social contract seems at first analogous to lockes but soon shows itselfmore akin to that of hobbes in the development from the state of nature there comes a time whenindividuals can no longer maintain themselves in primitive independence it then becomesnecessary to selfpreservation that they should unite to form a society but how can i pledge myliberty without harming my interests the problem is to find a form of association which willdefend and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each associate and inwhich each while uniting himself with all may still obey himself alone and remain as free asbefore this is the fundamental problem of which the social contract provides the solution the contract consists in the total alienation of each associate together with all his rights to thewhole community for in the first place as each gives himself absolutely the conditions are thesame 
such as those of france and england on the titlepage he calls himself citizen of geneva and inhis introductory sentences he says as i was born a citizen of a free state and a member of the sovereign i feel that however feeble the influence of my voice may have been on public affairsthe right of voting on them makes it my duty to study them there are frequent laudatoryreferences to sparta as it appears in plutarch life of lycurgus he says that democracy is best insmall states aristocracy in middlesized ones and monarchy in large ones but it is to beunderstood that in his opinion small states are preferable in part because they make democracymore practicable when he speaks of democracy he means as the greeks meant directparticipation of every citizen representative government he calls elective aristocracy since theformer is not possible in a large state his praise of democracy always implies praise of the city state this love of the city state is in my opinion not sufficiently emphasized in most accountsof rousseaus political philosophy although the book as a whole is much less rhetorical than most of rousseaus writing the firstchapter opens with a very forceful piece of rhetoric man is born free and everywhere he is inchains one man thinks himself the master of others but remains more of a slave than they areliberty is the nominal goal of rousseaus thought but in fact it is equality that he values and thathe seeks to secure even at the expense of liberty his conception of the social contract seems at first analogous to lockes but soon shows itselfmore akin to that of hobbes in the development from the state of nature there comes a time whenindividuals can no longer maintain themselves in primitive independence it then becomesnecessary to selfpreservation that they should unite to form a society but how can i pledge myliberty without harming my interests the problem is to find a form of association which willdefend and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each associate and inwhich each while uniting himself with all may still obey himself alone and remain as free asbefore this is the fundamental problem of which the social contract provides the solution the contract consists in the total alienation of each associate together with all his rights to thewhole community for in the first place as each gives himself absolutely the conditions are thesame for all and this being so no one has any interest in making them burdensome to others thealienation is to be without reserve if individuals retained certain rights as there would be nocommon superior to decide between them and the public each being on one point his own judgewould ask to be so on all the state of nature would thus continue and the association wouldnecessarily become inoperative or tyrannical this implies a complete abrogation of liberty and a complete rejection of the doctrine of the rightsof man it is true that in a later chapter there is some softening of this theory it is there said thatalthough the social contract gives the body politic absolute power over all its membersnevertheless human beings have natural rights as men the sovereign cannot impose upon itssubjects any fetters that are useless to the community nor can it even wish to do so but thesovereign is the sole judge of what is useful or useless to the community it is clear that only avery feeble obstacle is thus opposed to collective tyranny it should be observed that the sovereign means in rousseau not the monarch or thegovernment but the community in its collective and legislative capacity the social contract pan be stated in the following words each of us puts his person and all hispower in common under the supreme direction of the general will and in our corporate capacitywe receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole this act of association creates amoral and collective body which is called the state when passive the sovereign when activeand a power in relation to other bodies like itself the conception of the general will which appears in the above wording of the contract plays avery important part in rousseaus system i shall have more to say about it shortly it is argued that the sovereign need give no guarantees to its subjects for since it is formed of theindividuals who compose it it can have no interest contrary to theirs the sovereign merely byvirtue of what it is is always what it should be this doctrine is misleading to the reader whodoes not note rousseaus somewhat peculiar use of terms the sovereign is not the governmentwhich it is admitted may be tyrannical the sovereign is a more or less metaphysical entity notfully embodied in any of the visible organs of the state its im

portant and obscure the general will is not identical with the will of the majority or even withthe will of all the citizens it seems to be conceived as the will belonging to the body politic assuch if we take hobbess view that a civil society is a person we must suppose it endowed withthe attributes of personality including will but then we are faced with the difficulty of decidingwhat are the visible manifestations of this will and here rousseau leaves us in the dark we aretold that the general will is always right and always tends to the public advantage but that it doesnot follow that the deliberations of the people are equally correct for there is often a great deal ofdifference between the will of all and the general will how then are we to know what is thegeneral will there is in the same chapter a sort of answer if when the people being furnished with adequate information held its deliberations thecitizens had no communication one with another the grand total of the small differences wouldalways give the general will and the decision would always be good the conception in rousseaus mind seems to be this every mans political opinion is governed byselfinterest but selfinterest consists of two parts one of which is peculiar to the individualwhile the other is common to all the members of the community if the citizens have noopportunity of striking logrolling bargains with each other their individual interests beingdivergent will cancel out and there will be left a resultant which will represent their commoninterest this resultant is the general will perhaps rousseaus conception might be illustrated byterrestrial gravitation every particle in the earth attracts every other particle in the universetowards itself the air above us attracts us upward while the ground beneath us attracts usdownward but all these selfish attractions cancel each other out in so far as they are divergentand what remains is a resultant attraction towards the centre of the earth this might be fancifullyconceived as the act of the earth considered as a community and as the expression of its generalwill to say that the general will is always right is only to say that since it represents what is incommon among the selfinterests of the various citizens it must represent the largest collectivesatisfaction of selfinterest possible to the community this interpretation of rousseaus meaning seems to accord with his words better than any other that i have been able to think of in rousseaus opinion what interferes in practice with the expression of the general will is theexistence of subordinate associations within the state each of these will have its own generalwill which may conflict with that of the community as a whole it may then be said that thereare no longer as many votes as there are men but only as many as there are associations thisleads to an important consequence it is therefore essential if the general will is to be able toexpress itself that there should be no partial society within the state and that each citizenshould think only his own thoughts which was indeed the sublime and unique systemestablished by the great lycurgus in a footnote rousseau supports his opinion with theauthority of machiavelli consider what such a system would involve in practice the state would have to prohibitchurches political parties tradeunions and all other organizations ofmen with similar economic interests the result is obviously the corporate or totalitarian statein which the individual citizen is powerless rousseau seems to realize that it may be difficultto prohibit all associations and adds as an afterthought that if there must be subordinateassociations then the more there are the better in order that they may neutralize each other when in a later part of the book he comes to consider government he realizes that theexecutive is inevitably an association having an interest and a general will of its own whichmay easily conflict with that of the community he says that while the government of a large state needs to be stronger than that of a small one there is also more need of restraining thegovernment by means of the sovereign a member of the government has three wills hispersonal will the will of the government and the general will these three should form acrescendo but usually in fact form a diminuendo again everything conspires to take awayfrom a man who is set in authority over others the sense of justice and reason  eg there is often much difference between the will of all and the general will the latterconsiders only the common interest the former looks to private interest and is only a sumof particular wills but take away from these same wills the more and the less whichdestroy each other and the general will remains as the sum of the differences 
meaning seems to accord with his words better than any other that i have been able to think of in rousseaus opinion what interferes in practice with the expression of the general will is theexistence of subordinate associations within the state each of these will have its own generalwill which may conflict with that of the community as a whole it may then be said that thereare no longer as many votes as there are men but only as many as there are associations thisleads to an important consequence it is therefore essential if the general will is to be able toexpress itself that there should be no partial society within the state and that each citizenshould think only his own thoughts which was indeed the sublime and unique systemestablished by the great lycurgus in a footnote rousseau supports his opinion with theauthority of machiavelli consider what such a system would involve in practice the state would have to prohibitchurches political parties tradeunions and all other organizations ofmen with similar economic interests the result is obviously the corporate or totalitarian statein which the individual citizen is powerless rousseau seems to realize that it may be difficultto prohibit all associations and adds as an afterthought that if there must be subordinateassociations then the more there are the better in order that they may neutralize each other when in a later part of the book he comes to consider government he realizes that theexecutive is inevitably an association having an interest and a general will of its own whichmay easily conflict with that of the community he says that while the government of a large state needs to be stronger than that of a small one there is also more need of restraining thegovernment by means of the sovereign a member of the government has three wills hispersonal will the will of the government and the general will these three should form acrescendo but usually in fact form a diminuendo again everything conspires to take awayfrom a man who is set in authority over others the sense of justice and reason  eg there is often much difference between the will of all and the general will the latterconsiders only the common interest the former looks to private interest and is only a sumof particular wills but take away from these same wills the more and the less whichdestroy each other and the general will remains as the sum of the differences thus in spite of the infallibility of the general will which is always constant unalterable andpure all the old problems of eluding tyranny remain what rousseau has to say on theseproblems is either a surreptitious repetition of montesquieu or an insistence on the supremacy ofthe legislature which if democratic is identical with what he calls the sovereign the broadgeneral principles with which he starts and which he presents as if they solved political problemsdisappear when he condescends to detailed considerations towards the solution of which theycontribute nothing the condemnation of the book by contemporary reactionaries leads a modern reader to expect tofind in it a much more sweeping revolutionary doctrine than it in fact contains we may illustratethis by what is said about democracy when rousseau uses this word he means as we havealready seen the direct democracy of the ancient city state this he points out can never becompletely realized because the people cannot be always assembled and always occupied withpublic affairs were there a people of gods their government would be democratic so perfect agovernment is not for men what we call democracy he calls elective aristocracy this he says is the best of all governmentsbut it is not suitable to all countries the climate must be neither very hot nor very cold theproduce must not much exceed what is necessary for where it does the evil of luxury isinevitable and it is better that this evil should be confined to a monarch and his court thandiffused throughout the population in virtue of these limitations a large field is left for despoticgovernment nevertheless his advocacy of democracy in spite of its limitations was no doubt oneof the things that made the french government implacably hostile to the book the otherpresumably was the rejection of the divine right of kings which is implied in the doctrine of the social contract as the origin of government the social contract became the bible of most of the leaders in the french revolution but nodoubt as is the fate of bibles it was not carefully read and was still less understood by many of itsdisciples it reintroduced the habit of metaphysical abstractions among the theorists of democracyand by its doctrine of the general will it made possible the mystic identification of a leader withhis people which has no need of confirmation by so mundane an apparatus as the ballotbox 
thus in spite of the infallibility of the general will which is always constant unalterable andpure all the old problems of eluding tyranny remain what rousseau has to say on theseproblems is either a surreptitious repetition of montesquieu or an insistence on the supremacy ofthe legislature which if democratic is identical with what he calls the sovereign the broadgeneral principles with which he starts and which he presents as if they solved political problemsdisappear when he condescends to detailed considerations towards the solution of which theycontribute nothing the condemnation of the book by contemporary reactionaries leads a modern reader to expect tofind in it a much more sweeping revolutionary doctrine than it in fact contains we may illustratethis by what is said about democracy when rousseau uses this word he means as we havealready seen the direct democracy of the ancient city state this he points out can never becompletely realized because the people cannot be always assembled and always occupied withpublic affairs were there a people of gods their government would be democratic so perfect agovernment is not for men what we call democracy he calls elective aristocracy this he says is the best of all governmentsbut it is not suitable to all countries the climate must be neither very hot nor very cold theproduce must not much exceed what is necessary for where it does the evil of luxury isinevitable and it is better that this evil should be confined to a monarch and his court thandiffused throughout the population in virtue of these limitations a large field is left for despoticgovernment nevertheless his advocacy of democracy in spite of its limitations was no doubt oneof the things that made the french government implacably hostile to the book the otherpresumably was the rejection of the divine right of kings which is implied in the doctrine of the social contract as the origin of government the social contract became the bible of most of the leaders in the french revolution but nodoubt as is the fate of bibles it was not carefully read and was still less understood by many of itsdisciples it reintroduced the habit of metaphysical abstractions among the theorists of democracyand by its doctrine of the general will it made possible the mystic identification of a leader withhis people which has no need of confirmation by so mundane an apparatus as the ballotbox much of its philosophy could be appropriated by hegel in his defence of the prussianautocracy its firstfruits in practice was the reign of robespierre the dictatorships of russiaand germany are in part an outcome of rousseaus teaching what furthertriumphs the future has to offer to his ghost i do not venture to predict chapter xx kant a german idealism in general philosophy in the eighteenth century was dominated by the british empiricists of whom locke berkeley and hume may be taken as the representatives in these men there was aconflict of which they themselves appear to have been unaware between their temper of mindand the tendency of their theoretical doctrines in their temper of mind they were sociallyminded citizens by no means selfassertive not unduly anxious for power and in favour of atolerant world where within the limits of the criminal law every man could do as he pleased they were goodnatured men of the world urbane and kindly but while their temper was social their theoretical philosophy led to subjectivism this was nota new tendency it had existed in late antiquity most emphatically in saint augustine it wasrevived in modern times by descartess cogito and reached a momentary culmination in leibnizs windowless monads leibniz believed that everything in his experience would beunchanged if the rest of the world were annihilated nevertheless he devoted himself to thereunion of  hegel selects for special praise the distinction between the general will and the will of all he says rousseau would have made a sounder contribution towards a theory of the state if he had always kept this distinction in sight

the catholic and protestant churches a similar inconsistency appears in locke berkeley and hume in locke the inconsistency is still in the theory we saw in an earlier chapter that locke says onthe one hand since the mind in all its thoughts and reasonings hath no other immediate objectbut its own ideas which it alone does or can contemplate it is evident that our knowledge is onlyconversant about them and knowledge is the perception of the agreement or disagreement oftwo ideas nevertheless he maintains that we have three kinds of knowledge of real existenceintuitive of our own demonstrative of gods and sensitive of things present to sense simpleideas he maintains are the product of things operating on the mind in a natural way how heknows this he does not explain it certainly goes beyond the agreement or disagreement of twoideas berkeley took an important step towards ending this inconsistency for him there are only mindsand their ideas the physical external world is abolished but he still failed to grasp all theconsequences of the epistemological principles that he took over from locke if he had beencompletely consistent he would have denied knowledge of god and of all minds except his own from such denial he was held back by his feelings as a clergyman and as a social being hume shrank from nothing in pursuit of theoretical consistency but felt no impulse to make hispractice conform to his theory hume denied the self and threw doubt on induction andcausation he accepted berkeleys abolition of matter but not the substitute that berkeley offeredin the form of gods ideas it is true that like locke he admitted no simple idea without anantecedent impression and no doubt he imagined an impression as a state of mind directlycaused by something external to the mind but he could not admit this as a definition ofimpression since he questioned the notion of cause i doubt whether either he or his discipleswere ever clearly aware of this problem as to impressions obviously on his view animpression would have to be defined by some intrinsic character distinguishing it from anidea since it could not be defined causally he could not therefore argue that impressions giveknowledge of things external to ourselves as had been done by locke and in a modified form by berkeley he should therefore have believed him self shut up in a solipsistic world and ignorant of everything except his own mental states andtheir relations hume by his consistency showed that empiricism carried to its logical conclusion led to resultswhich few human beings could bring themselves to accept and abolished over the whole field ofscience the distinction between rational belief and credulity locke had foreseen this danger heputs into the mouth of a supposed critic the argument if knowledge consists in agreement ofideas the enthusiast and the sober man are on a level locke living at a time when men hadgrown tired of enthusiasm found no difficulty in persuading men of the validity of his reply tothis criticism rousseau coming at a moment when people were in turn getting tired of reasonrevived enthusiasm and accepting the bankruptcy of reason allowed the heart to decidequestions which the head left doubtful from to the heart spoke louder and louder atlast thermidor put an end for a time to its ferocious pronouncements so far at least as francewas concerned under napoleon heart and head were alike silenced in germany the reaction against humes agnosticism took a form far more profound and subtlethan that which rousseau had given to it kant fichte and hegel developed a new kind ofphilosophy intended to safeguard both knowledge and virtue from the subversive doctrines of thelate eighteenth century in kant and still more in fichte the subjectivist tendency that begins with descartes was carried to new extremes in this respect there was at first no reaction against hume as regards subjectivism the reaction began with hegel who sought through his logic toestablish a new way of escape from the individual into the world the whole of german idealism has affinities with the romantic movement these are obvious in fichte and still more so in schelling they are least so in hegel kant the founder of german idealism is not himself politically important though he wrote someinteresting essays on political subjects fichte and hegel on the other hand both set forth politicaldoctrines which had and still have a profound influence upon the course of history neither canbe understood without a previous study of kant whom we shall consider in this chapter

 similarly since you always wear spatial spectacles in your mindyou are sure of always seeing everything in space thus geometry is a priori in the sense that itmust be true of everything experienced but we have no reason to suppose that anything analogousis true of things in themselves which we do not experience space and time kant says are not concepts they are forms of intuition there are also however a prioriconcepts these are the twelve categories which kant derives from the forms of the syllogism the twelve categories are divided into four sets of three of quantity unity plurality totality of quality reality negation limitation of relation substanceandaccident causeandeffect reciprocity of modality possibility existence necessity these are subjective in thesame sense in which space and time arethat is to say our mental constitution is such that theyare applicable to whatever we experience but there is no reason to suppose them applicable tothings in themselves as regards cause however there is an inconsistency for things inthemselves are regarded by kant as causes of sensations and free volitions are held by him to becauses of occurrences in space and time this inconsistency is not an accidental oversight it is anessential part of his system a large part of the critique of pure reason is occupied in showing the fallacies that arise fromapplying space and time or the categories to things that are not experienced when this is done so kant maintains we find ourselves troubled by antinomiesthat is to say by mutuallycontradictory propositions each of which can apparently be proved kant gives four suchantinomies each consisting of thesis and antithesis in the first the thesis says the world has a beginning in time and is also limited as regardsspace the antithesis says the world has no beginning in time and no limits in space it isinfinite as regards both time and space the second antinomy proves that every composite substance both is and is not made up of simpleparts the thesis of the third antinomy maintains that there are two kinds of causality one according to the laws of nature the other that of freedom the antithesismaintains that there is only causality according to the laws of nature the fourth antinomy proves that there is and is not an absolutely necessary being this part of the critique greatly influenced hegel whose dialectic proceeds wholly by way ofantinomies in a famous section kant sets to work to demolish all the purely intellectual proofs of theexistence of god he makes it clear that he has other reasons for believing in god these he was toset forth later in the critique of practical reason but for the time being his purpose is purelynegative there are he says only three proofs of gods existence by pure reason these are the ontologicalproof the cosmological proof and the physicotheological proof the ontological proof as he sets it forth defines god as the ens realissimum the most real beingie the subject of all predicates that belong to being absolutely it is contended by those whobelieve the proof valid that since existence is such a predicate this subject must have thepredicate existence ie must exist kant objects that existence is not a predicate a hundredthalers that i merely imagine may he says have all the same predicates as a hundred real thalers the cosmological proof says if anything exists then an absolutely necessary being must existnow i know that i exist therefore an absolutely necessary being exists and this must be the ensrealissimum kant maintains that the last step in this argument is the ontological argument overagain and that it is therefore refuted by what has been already said the physicotheological proof is the familiar argument from design but in a metaphysical dress itmaintains that the universe exhibits an order which is evidence of purpose this argument istreated by kant with respect but he points out that at best it proves only an architect not a creator and therefore cannot give an adequate conception of god he concludes that the onlytheology of reason which is possible is that which is based upon moral laws or seeks guidancefrom them god freedom and immortality he says are the three ideas of reason but although pure reasonleads us to form these ideas it 
of causality one according to the laws of nature the other that of freedom the antithesismaintains that there is only causality according to the laws of nature the fourth antinomy proves that there is and is not an absolutely necessary being this part of the critique greatly influenced hegel whose dialectic proceeds wholly by way ofantinomies in a famous section kant sets to work to demolish all the purely intellectual proofs of theexistence of god he makes it clear that he has other reasons for believing in god these he was toset forth later in the critique of practical reason but for the time being his purpose is purelynegative there are he says only three proofs of gods existence by pure reason these are the ontologicalproof the cosmological proof and the physicotheological proof the ontological proof as he sets it forth defines god as the ens realissimum the most real beingie the subject of all predicates that belong to being absolutely it is contended by those whobelieve the proof valid that since existence is such a predicate this subject must have thepredicate existence ie must exist kant objects that existence is not a predicate a hundredthalers that i merely imagine may he says have all the same predicates as a hundred real thalers the cosmological proof says if anything exists then an absolutely necessary being must existnow i know that i exist therefore an absolutely necessary being exists and this must be the ensrealissimum kant maintains that the last step in this argument is the ontological argument overagain and that it is therefore refuted by what has been already said the physicotheological proof is the familiar argument from design but in a metaphysical dress itmaintains that the universe exhibits an order which is evidence of purpose this argument istreated by kant with respect but he points out that at best it proves only an architect not a creator and therefore cannot give an adequate conception of god he concludes that the onlytheology of reason which is possible is that which is based upon moral laws or seeks guidancefrom them god freedom and immortality he says are the three ideas of reason but although pure reasonleads us to form these ideas it cannot itself prove their reality the importance of these ideas is practical ie connected withmorals the purely intellectual use of reason leads to fallacies its only right use is directed tomoral ends the practical use of reason is developed briefly near the end of the critique of pure reason andmore fully in the critique of practical reason the argument is that the moral lawdemands justice ie happiness proportional to virtue only providence can insure this and hasevidently not insured it in this life therefore there is a god and a future life and there must befreedom since otherwise there would be no such thing as virtue kant ethical system as set forth in his metaphysic of morals has considerable historicalimportance this book contains the categorical imperative which at least as a phrase isfamiliar outside the circle of professional philosophers as might be expected kant will havenothing to do with utilitarianism or with any doctrine which gives to morality a purpose outsideitself he wants he says a completely isolated metaphysic of morals which is not mixed withany theology or physics or hyperphysics all moral concepts he continues have their seat andorigin wholly a priori in the reason moral worth exists only when a man acts from a sense ofduty it is not enough that the act should be such as duty might have prescribed the tradesmanwho is honest from selfinterest or the man who is kind from benevolent impulse is not virtuous the essence of morality is to be derived from the concept of law for though everything in natureacts according to laws only a rational being has the power of acting according to the idea of a lawie by will the idea of an objective principle in so far as it is compelling to the will is called acommand of the reason and the formula of the command is called an imperative there are two sorts of imperative the hypothetical imperative which says you must do soandso if you wish to achieve suchandsuch an end and the categorical imperative which says that acertain kind of action is objectively necessary without regard to any end the categoricalimperative is synthetic and a priori its character is deduced by kant from the concept of law if i think of a categorical imperative i know at once what it contains for as the imperativecontains besides the law only the necessity of the maxim to be in accordance with this law butthe law 
cannot itself prove their reality the importance of these ideas is practical ie connected withmorals the purely intellectual use of reason leads to fallacies its only right use is directed tomoral ends the practical use of reason is developed briefly near the end of the critique of pure reason andmore fully in the critique of practical reason the argument is that the moral lawdemands justice ie happiness proportional to virtue only providence can insure this and hasevidently not insured it in this life therefore there is a god and a future life and there must befreedom since otherwise there would be no such thing as virtue kant ethical system as set forth in his metaphysic of morals has considerable historicalimportance this book contains the categorical imperative which at least as a phrase isfamiliar outside the circle of professional philosophers as might be expected kant will havenothing to do with utilitarianism or with any doctrine which gives to morality a purpose outsideitself he wants he says a completely isolated metaphysic of morals which is not mixed withany theology or physics or hyperphysics all moral concepts he continues have their seat andorigin wholly a priori in the reason moral worth exists only when a man acts from a sense ofduty it is not enough that the act should be such as duty might have prescribed the tradesmanwho is honest from selfinterest or the man who is kind from benevolent impulse is not virtuous the essence of morality is to be derived from the concept of law for though everything in natureacts according to laws only a rational being has the power of acting according to the idea of a lawie by will the idea of an objective principle in so far as it is compelling to the will is called acommand of the reason and the formula of the command is called an imperative there are two sorts of imperative the hypothetical imperative which says you must do soandso if you wish to achieve suchandsuch an end and the categorical imperative which says that acertain kind of action is objectively necessary without regard to any end the categoricalimperative is synthetic and a priori its character is deduced by kant from the concept of law if i think of a categorical imperative i know at once what it contains for as the imperativecontains besides the law only the necessity of the maxim to be in accordance with this law butthe law contains no condition by which it is limited nothing remains over but the generality of a law ingeneral to which the maxim of the actions is to be conformable and which conforming alonepresents the imperative as necessary therefore the categorical imperative is a single one and infact this act only according to a maxim by which you can at the same time will that it shallbecome a general law or act as if the maxim of your action were to become through your willa general natural law kant gives as an illustration of the working of the categorical imperative that it is wrong to borrowmoney because if we all tried to do so there would be no money left to borrow one can in likemanner show that theft and murder are condemned by the categorical imperative but there aresome acts which kant would certainly think wrong but which cannot be shown to be wrong by hisprinciples for instance suicide it would be quite possible for a melancholic to wish thateverybody should commit suicide his maxim seems in fact to give a necessary but not asufficient criterion of virtue to get a sufficient criterion we should have to abandon kants purelyformal point of view and take some account of the effects of actions kant however statesemphatically that virtue does not depend upon the intended result of an action but only on theprinciple of which it is itself a result and if this is conceded nothing more concrete than hismaxim is possible kant maintains although his principle does not seem to entail this consequence that we ought soto act as to treat every man as an end in himself this may be regarded as an abstract form of thedoctrine of the rights of man and it is open to the same objections if taken seriously it wouldmake it impossible to reach a decision whenever two peoples interests conflict the difficultiesare particularly obvious in political philosophy which requires some principle such as preferencefor the majority by which the interests of some can when necessary be sacrificed to those ofothers if there is to be any ethic of government the end of government must be one and the onlysingle end compatible with justice is the good of the community it is possible however tointerpret kants principle as meaning not that each man is an absolute end but that all men shouldcount equally in determining actions by which many are affected so interpreted the 
contains no condition by which it is limited nothing remains over but the generality of a law ingeneral to which the maxim of the actions is to be conformable and which conforming alonepresents the imperative as necessary therefore the categorical imperative is a single one and infact this act only according to a maxim by which you can at the same time will that it shallbecome a general law or act as if the maxim of your action were to become through your willa general natural law kant gives as an illustration of the working of the categorical imperative that it is wrong to borrowmoney because if we all tried to do so there would be no money left to borrow one can in likemanner show that theft and murder are condemned by the categorical imperative but there aresome acts which kant would certainly think wrong but which cannot be shown to be wrong by hisprinciples for instance suicide it would be quite possible for a melancholic to wish thateverybody should commit suicide his maxim seems in fact to give a necessary but not asufficient criterion of virtue to get a sufficient criterion we should have to abandon kants purelyformal point of view and take some account of the effects of actions kant however statesemphatically that virtue does not depend upon the intended result of an action but only on theprinciple of which it is itself a result and if this is conceded nothing more concrete than hismaxim is possible kant maintains although his principle does not seem to entail this consequence that we ought soto act as to treat every man as an end in himself this may be regarded as an abstract form of thedoctrine of the rights of man and it is open to the same objections if taken seriously it wouldmake it impossible to reach a decision whenever two peoples interests conflict the difficultiesare particularly obvious in political philosophy which requires some principle such as preferencefor the majority by which the interests of some can when necessary be sacrificed to those ofothers if there is to be any ethic of government the end of government must be one and the onlysingle end compatible with justice is the good of the community it is possible however tointerpret kants principle as meaning not that each man is an absolute end but that all men shouldcount equally in determining actions by which many are affected so interpreted the principle

objects of perception as i do rather thanother wise why for instance do i always see peoples eyes above their mouths and not below them according to kant the eyes and the mouth exist as things in themselves and cause my separatepercepts but nothing in them corresponds to the spatial arrangement that exists in my perception contrast with this the physical theory of colours we do not suppose that in matter there arecolours in the sense in which our percepts have colours but we do think that different colourscorrespond to different wavelengths since waves however involve space and time therecannot for kant be waves in the causes of our percepts if on the other hand the space and timeof our percepts have counterparts in the world of matter as physics assumes then geometry isapplicable to these counterparts and kants arguments fail kant holds that the mind orders theraw material of sensation but never thinks it necessary to say why it orders it as it does and nototherwise in regard to time this difficulty is even greater because of the intrusion of causality i perceive thelightning before i perceive the thunder a thinginitself a caused my perception of lightning andanother thinginitself b caused my perception of thunder but a was not earlier than b since timeexists only in the relations of percepts why then do the two timeless things a and b produceeffects at different times this must be wholly arbitrary if kant is right and there must be norelation betwen a and b corresponding to the fact that the percept caused by a is earlier than thatcaused by b the second metaphysical argument maintains that it is possible to imagine nothing in space butimpossible to imagine no space it seems to me that no serious argument can be based upon whatwe can or cannot imagine but i should emphatically deny that we can imagine space with nothingin it you can imagine looking at the sky on a dark cloudy night but then you yourself are inspace and you imagine the clouds that you cannot see kants space is absolute like newtonsand not merely a system of relations but i do not see how absolute empty space can be imagined the third metaphysical argument says space is not a discursive or as is said general concept ofthe relations of things in general but a pure intuition for in the first place we can only imaginesich vorstellen one single space and if we speak of spaces we mean only parts of one and thesame unique space and these parts cannot precede the whole as its parts  but can only bethought as in it it 
wise why for instance do i always see peoples eyes above their mouths and not below them according to kant the eyes and the mouth exist as things in themselves and cause my separatepercepts but nothing in them corresponds to the spatial arrangement that exists in my perception contrast with this the physical theory of colours we do not suppose that in matter there arecolours in the sense in which our percepts have colours but we do think that different colourscorrespond to different wavelengths since waves however involve space and time therecannot for kant be waves in the causes of our percepts if on the other hand the space and timeof our percepts have counterparts in the world of matter as physics assumes then geometry isapplicable to these counterparts and kants arguments fail kant holds that the mind orders theraw material of sensation but never thinks it necessary to say why it orders it as it does and nototherwise in regard to time this difficulty is even greater because of the intrusion of causality i perceive thelightning before i perceive the thunder a thinginitself a caused my perception of lightning andanother thinginitself b caused my perception of thunder but a was not earlier than b since timeexists only in the relations of percepts why then do the two timeless things a and b produceeffects at different times this must be wholly arbitrary if kant is right and there must be norelation betwen a and b corresponding to the fact that the percept caused by a is earlier than thatcaused by b the second metaphysical argument maintains that it is possible to imagine nothing in space butimpossible to imagine no space it seems to me that no serious argument can be based upon whatwe can or cannot imagine but i should emphatically deny that we can imagine space with nothingin it you can imagine looking at the sky on a dark cloudy night but then you yourself are inspace and you imagine the clouds that you cannot see kants space is absolute like newtonsand not merely a system of relations but i do not see how absolute empty space can be imagined the third metaphysical argument says space is not a discursive or as is said general concept ofthe relations of things in general but a pure intuition for in the first place we can only imaginesich vorstellen one single space and if we speak of spaces we mean only parts of one and thesame unique space and these parts cannot precede the whole as its parts  but can only bethought as in it it space is essentially unique the manifold in it rests solely on limitations from this it isconcluded that space is an a priori intuition the gist of this argument is the denial of plurality in space itself what we call spaces areneither instances of a general concept a space nor parts of an aggregate i do not know quitewhat according to kant their logical status is but in any case they are logically subsequent tospace to those who take as practically all moderns do a relational view of space this argumentbecomes incapable of being stated since neither space nor spaces can survive as a substantive the fourth metaphysical argument is chiefly concerned to prove that space is an intuition not aconcept its premiss is space is imagined for presented vorgestellt as an infinite givenmagnitude this is the view of a person living in a flat country like that of knigsberg i do notsee how an inhabitant of an alpine valley could adopt it it is difficult to see how anything infinitecan be given i should have thought it obvious that the part of space that is given is that which ispeopled by objects of perception and that for other parts we have only a feeling of possibility ofmotion and if so vulgar an argument may be intruded modern astronomers maintain that space isin fact not infinite but goes round and round like the surface of the globe the transcendental argument which is best stated in the prolegomena ismore definite than the metaphysical arguments and is also more definitely refutable geometryas we now know is a name covering two different studies on the one hand there is puregeometry which deduces consequences from axioms without inquiring whether the axioms aretrue this contains nothing that does not follow from logic and is not synthetic and has noneed of figures such as are used in geometrical textbooks on the other hand there is geometry asa branch of physics as it appears for example in the general theory of relativity this is anempirical science in which the axioms are inferred from measurements and are found to differfrom euclids thus of the two kinds of geometry one is a priori but not synthetic while the otheris synthetic but not a priori this disposes of the transcendental argument let us now try to consider the questions raised by kant as regards space in a more general way ifwe adopt the view which is taken for granted in physics that our percepts have external causeswhich 
space is essentially unique the manifold in it rests solely on limitations from this it isconcluded that space is an a priori intuition the gist of this argument is the denial of plurality in space itself what we call spaces areneither instances of a general concept a space nor parts of an aggregate i do not know quitewhat according to kant their logical status is but in any case they are logically subsequent tospace to those who take as practically all moderns do a relational view of space this argumentbecomes incapable of being stated since neither space nor spaces can survive as a substantive the fourth metaphysical argument is chiefly concerned to prove that space is an intuition not aconcept its premiss is space is imagined for presented vorgestellt as an infinite givenmagnitude this is the view of a person living in a flat country like that of knigsberg i do notsee how an inhabitant of an alpine valley could adopt it it is difficult to see how anything infinitecan be given i should have thought it obvious that the part of space that is given is that which ispeopled by objects of perception and that for other parts we have only a feeling of possibility ofmotion and if so vulgar an argument may be intruded modern astronomers maintain that space isin fact not infinite but goes round and round like the surface of the globe the transcendental argument which is best stated in the prolegomena ismore definite than the metaphysical arguments and is also more definitely refutable geometryas we now know is a name covering two different studies on the one hand there is puregeometry which deduces consequences from axioms without inquiring whether the axioms aretrue this contains nothing that does not follow from logic and is not synthetic and has noneed of figures such as are used in geometrical textbooks on the other hand there is geometry asa branch of physics as it appears for example in the general theory of relativity this is anempirical science in which the axioms are inferred from measurements and are found to differfrom euclids thus of the two kinds of geometry one is a priori but not synthetic while the otheris synthetic but not a priori this disposes of the transcendental argument let us now try to consider the questions raised by kant as regards space in a more general way ifwe adopt the view which is taken for granted in physics that our percepts have external causeswhich are material we are led to the conclusion that all the actual qualities in perceptsare different from those in their unperceived causes but that there is a certain structural similaritybetween the system of percepts and the system of their causes there is for example a correlationbetween colours and wavelengths similarly there mustbe a correlation between space as an ingredient in percepts and space as an ingredient in thesystem of unperceived causes of percepts all this rests upon the maxim same cause sameeffect with its obverse different effects different causes thus eg when a visual percept aappears to the left of a visual percept b we shall suppose that there is some correspondingrelation between the cause of a and the cause of b we have on this view two spaces one subjective and one objective one known in experienceand the other merely inferred but there is no difference in this respect between space and otheraspects of perception such as colours and sounds all alike in their subjective forms are knownempirically all alike in their objective forms are inferred by means of a maxim as to causation there is no reason whatever for regarding our knowledge of space as in any way different fromour knowledge of colour and sound and smell with regard to time the matter is different since if we adhere to the belief in unperceived causesof percepts the objective time must be identical with the subjective time if not we get into thedifficulties already considered in connection with lightning and thunder or take such a case as thefollowing you hear a man speak you answer him and he hears you his speaking and hishearing of your reply are both so far as you are concerned in the unperceived world and in thatworld the former precedes the latter moreover his speaking precedes your hearing in the objectiveworld of physics your hearing precedes your reply in the subjective world of percepts and yourreply precedes his hearing in the objective world of physics it is clear that the relation precedesmust be the same in all these propositions while therefore there is an important sense in whichperceptual space is subjective there is no sense in which perceptual time is subjective the above arguments assume as kant does that percepts are caused by things in themselves oras we should say by events in the world 
are material we are led to the conclusion that all the actual qualities in perceptsare different from those in their unperceived causes but that there is a certain structural similaritybetween the system of percepts and the system of their causes there is for example a correlationbetween colours and wavelengths similarly there mustbe a correlation between space as an ingredient in percepts and space as an ingredient in thesystem of unperceived causes of percepts all this rests upon the maxim same cause sameeffect with its obverse different effects different causes thus eg when a visual percept aappears to the left of a visual percept b we shall suppose that there is some correspondingrelation between the cause of a and the cause of b we have on this view two spaces one subjective and one objective one known in experienceand the other merely inferred but there is no difference in this respect between space and otheraspects of perception such as colours and sounds all alike in their subjective forms are knownempirically all alike in their objective forms are inferred by means of a maxim as to causation there is no reason whatever for regarding our knowledge of space as in any way different fromour knowledge of colour and sound and smell with regard to time the matter is different since if we adhere to the belief in unperceived causesof percepts the objective time must be identical with the subjective time if not we get into thedifficulties already considered in connection with lightning and thunder or take such a case as thefollowing you hear a man speak you answer him and he hears you his speaking and hishearing of your reply are both so far as you are concerned in the unperceived world and in thatworld the former precedes the latter moreover his speaking precedes your hearing in the objectiveworld of physics your hearing precedes your reply in the subjective world of percepts and yourreply precedes his hearing in the objective world of physics it is clear that the relation precedesmust be the same in all these propositions while therefore there is an important sense in whichperceptual space is subjective there is no sense in which perceptual time is subjective the above arguments assume as kant does that percepts are caused by things in themselves oras we should say by events in the world of physics this assumption however is by no means logically necessary if it is abandonedpercepts cease to be in any important sense subjective since there is nothing with which tocontrast them the thinginitself was an awkward element in kants

of machine production on the imaginative picture of the world is animmense increase in the sense of human power this is only an acceleration of a process whichbegan before the dawn of history when men

all the greatphilosophers before entering on any detail a general characterization may prove helpful from his early interest in mysticism he retained a belief in the unreality of separateness the worldin his view was not a collection of hard units whether atoms or souls each completely selfsubsistent the apparent selfsubsistence of finite things appeared to him to be an illusionnothing he held is ultimately and completely real except the whole but he differed from parmenides and spinoza in conceiving the whole not as a simple substance but as a complexsystem of the sort that we should call an organism the apparently separate things of which theworld seems to be composed are not simply an illusion each has a greater or lesser degree ofreality and its reality consists in an aspect of the whole which is what it is seen to be whenviewed truly with this view goes naturally a disbelief in the reality of time and space as such forthese if taken as completely real involve separateness and multiplicity all this must have cometo him first as mystic insight its intellectual elaboration which is given in his books must havecome later hegel asserts that the real is rational and the rational is real but when he says this he does notmean by the real what an empiricist would mean he admits and even urges that what to theempiricist appear to be facts are and must be irrational it is only after their apparent characterhas been transformed by viewing them as aspects of the whole that they are seen to be rational nevertheless the identification of the real and the rational leads unavoidably to some of thecomplacency inseparable from the belief that whatever is is right the whole in all its complexity is called by hegelthe absolute the absolute is spiritual spinozas view that it has the attribute of extension as well as that of thought is rejected two things distinguish hegel from other men who have had a more or less similar metaphysicaloutlook one of these is emphasis on logic it is thought by hegel that the nature of reality can bededuced from the sole consideration that it must be not selfcontradictory the otherdistinguishing feature is the triadic movement called thedialectic his most important books are his two logics and these must be understood if thereasons for his views on other subjects are to be rightly apprehended logic as hegel understands the word is declared by him to be 
from his early interest in mysticism he retained a belief in the unreality of separateness the worldin his view was not a collection of hard units whether atoms or souls each completely selfsubsistent the apparent selfsubsistence of finite things appeared to him to be an illusionnothing he held is ultimately and completely real except the whole but he differed from parmenides and spinoza in conceiving the whole not as a simple substance but as a complexsystem of the sort that we should call an organism the apparently separate things of which theworld seems to be composed are not simply an illusion each has a greater or lesser degree ofreality and its reality consists in an aspect of the whole which is what it is seen to be whenviewed truly with this view goes naturally a disbelief in the reality of time and space as such forthese if taken as completely real involve separateness and multiplicity all this must have cometo him first as mystic insight its intellectual elaboration which is given in his books must havecome later hegel asserts that the real is rational and the rational is real but when he says this he does notmean by the real what an empiricist would mean he admits and even urges that what to theempiricist appear to be facts are and must be irrational it is only after their apparent characterhas been transformed by viewing them as aspects of the whole that they are seen to be rational nevertheless the identification of the real and the rational leads unavoidably to some of thecomplacency inseparable from the belief that whatever is is right the whole in all its complexity is called by hegelthe absolute the absolute is spiritual spinozas view that it has the attribute of extension as well as that of thought is rejected two things distinguish hegel from other men who have had a more or less similar metaphysicaloutlook one of these is emphasis on logic it is thought by hegel that the nature of reality can bededuced from the sole consideration that it must be not selfcontradictory the otherdistinguishing feature is the triadic movement called thedialectic his most important books are his two logics and these must be understood if thereasons for his views on other subjects are to be rightly apprehended logic as hegel understands the word is declared by him to be the same thing as metaphysics it is something quite different from what is commonly called logic his view is that any ordinary predicate if taken as qualifying the whole of reality turns out to beselfcontradictory one might take as a crude example the theory of parmenides that the onewhich alone is real is spherical nothing can be spherical unless it has a boundary and it cannothave a boundary unless there is something outside of it therefore tosuppose the universe as a whole to be spherical is selfcontradictory or let ustake another illustration still more crudefar too much so to be used by hegel you may saywithout apparent contradiction that mr a is an uncle but if you were to say that the universe isan uncle you would land yourself in difficulties an uncle is a man who has a nephew and thenephew is a separate person from the uncle therefore an uncle cannot be the whole of reality this illustration might also be used to illustrate the dialectic which consists of thesis antithesisand synthesis first we say reality is an uncle this is the thesis but the existence of an uncleimplies that of a nephew since nothing really exists except the absolute and we are nowcommitted to the existence of a nephew we must conclude the absolute is a nephew this isthe antithesis but there is the same objection to this as to the view that the absolute is an uncletherefore we are driven to the view that the absolute is the whole composed of uncle and nephew this is the synthesis but this synthesis is still unsatisfactory because a man can be an uncle onlyif he has a brother or sister who is a parent of the nephew hence we are driven to enlarge ouruniverse to include the brother or sister with his wife or her husband in this sort of way so it iscontended we can be driven on by the mere force of logic from any suggested predicate of the absolute to the final conclusion of the dialectic which is called the absolute idea throughoutthe whole process there is an underlying assumption that nothing can be really true unless it isabout reality as a whole for this underlying assumption there is a basis in traditional logic which assumes that everyproposition has a subject and a predicate according to this view every fact consists in somethinghaving some 
the same thing as metaphysics it is something quite different from what is commonly called logic his view is that any ordinary predicate if taken as qualifying the whole of reality turns out to beselfcontradictory one might take as a crude example the theory of parmenides that the onewhich alone is real is spherical nothing can be spherical unless it has a boundary and it cannothave a boundary unless there is something outside of it therefore tosuppose the universe as a whole to be spherical is selfcontradictory or let ustake another illustration still more crudefar too much so to be used by hegel you may saywithout apparent contradiction that mr a is an uncle but if you were to say that the universe isan uncle you would land yourself in difficulties an uncle is a man who has a nephew and thenephew is a separate person from the uncle therefore an uncle cannot be the whole of reality this illustration might also be used to illustrate the dialectic which consists of thesis antithesisand synthesis first we say reality is an uncle this is the thesis but the existence of an uncleimplies that of a nephew since nothing really exists except the absolute and we are nowcommitted to the existence of a nephew we must conclude the absolute is a nephew this isthe antithesis but there is the same objection to this as to the view that the absolute is an uncletherefore we are driven to the view that the absolute is the whole composed of uncle and nephew this is the synthesis but this synthesis is still unsatisfactory because a man can be an uncle onlyif he has a brother or sister who is a parent of the nephew hence we are driven to enlarge ouruniverse to include the brother or sister with his wife or her husband in this sort of way so it iscontended we can be driven on by the mere force of logic from any suggested predicate of the absolute to the final conclusion of the dialectic which is called the absolute idea throughoutthe whole process there is an underlying assumption that nothing can be really true unless it isabout reality as a whole for this underlying assumption there is a basis in traditional logic which assumes that everyproposition has a subject and a predicate according to this view every fact consists in somethinghaving some property it follows that relations cannot be real since they involve two things not one uncle isa relation and a man may become an uncle without knowing it in that case from an empiricalpoint of view the man is unaffected by becoming an uncle he has no quality which he did nothave before if by quality we understand something necessary to describing him as he is inhimself apart from his relations to other people and things the only way in which the subjectpredicate logic can avoid this difficulty is to say that the truth is not a property of the uncle aloneor of the nephew alone but of the whole composed of uncleandnephew since everythingexcept the whole has relations to outside things it follows that nothing quite true can be saidabout separate things and that in fact only the whole is real this follows more directly from thefact that a and b are two is not a subjectpredicate proposition and therefore on the basis of thetraditional logic there can be no such proposition therefore there are not as many as two thingsin the world therefore the whole considered as a unity is alone real the above argument is not explicit in hegel but is implicit in his system as in that of many othermetaphysicians a few examples of hegels dialectic method may serve to make it more intelligible he begins theargument of his logic by the assumption that the absolute is pure being we assume that it justis without assigning any qualities to it but pure being without any qualities is nothing thereforewe are led to the antithesis the absolute is nothing from this thesis and antithesis we pass onto the synthesis the union of being and not being is becoming and so we say the absolute is becoming this also of course wont do because there has to be something that becomes in thisway our views of reality develop by the continual correction of previous errors all of which arosefrom undue abstraction by taking something finite or limited as if it could be the whole thelimitations of the finite do not come merely from without its own nature is the cause of itsabrogation and by its own act it passes into its counterpart the process according to hegel is essential to the understanding of the result each later stage ofthe dialectic contains all the earlier stages as it were in solution none of them is whollysuperseded but is given its proper place as a moment in the whole it is therefore 
property it follows that relations cannot be real since they involve two things not one uncle isa relation and a man may become an uncle without knowing it in that case from an empiricalpoint of view the man is unaffected by becoming an uncle he has no quality which he did nothave before if by quality we understand something necessary to describing him as he is inhimself apart from his relations to other people and things the only way in which the subjectpredicate logic can avoid this difficulty is to say that the truth is not a property of the uncle aloneor of the nephew alone but of the whole composed of uncleandnephew since everythingexcept the whole has relations to outside things it follows that nothing quite true can be saidabout separate things and that in fact only the whole is real this follows more directly from thefact that a and b are two is not a subjectpredicate proposition and therefore on the basis of thetraditional logic there can be no such proposition therefore there are not as many as two thingsin the world therefore the whole considered as a unity is alone real the above argument is not explicit in hegel but is implicit in his system as in that of many othermetaphysicians a few examples of hegels dialectic method may serve to make it more intelligible he begins theargument of his logic by the assumption that the absolute is pure being we assume that it justis without assigning any qualities to it but pure being without any qualities is nothing thereforewe are led to the antithesis the absolute is nothing from this thesis and antithesis we pass onto the synthesis the union of being and not being is becoming and so we say the absolute is becoming this also of course wont do because there has to be something that becomes in thisway our views of reality develop by the continual correction of previous errors all of which arosefrom undue abstraction by taking something finite or limited as if it could be the whole thelimitations of the finite do not come merely from without its own nature is the cause of itsabrogation and by its own act it passes into its counterpart the process according to hegel is essential to the understanding of the result each later stage ofthe dialectic contains all the earlier stages as it were in solution none of them is whollysuperseded but is given its proper place as a moment in the whole it is therefore impossible to reach the truth except by going through all the steps of the dialectic knowledge as a whole has its triadic movement it begins with senseperception in which there isonly awareness of the object then through sceptical criticism of the senses it becomes purelysubjective at last it reaches the stage of selfknowledge in which subject and object are nolonger distinct thus selfconsciousness is the highest form of knowledge this of course mustbe the case in hegels system for the highest kind of knowledge must be that possessed by the absolute and as the absolute is the whole there is nothing outside itself for it to know in the best thinking according to hegel thoughts become fluent and interfuse truth andfalsehood are not sharply defined opposites as is commonly supposed nothing is wholly falseand nothing that we can know is wholly true we can know in a way that is false this happenswhen we attribute absolute truth to some detached piece of information such a question as where was caesar born has a straightforward answer which is true in a sense but not in thephilosophical sense for philosophy the truth is the whole and nothing partial is quite true reason hegel says is the conscious certainty of being all reality this does not mean that aseparate person is all reality in his separateness he is not quite real but what is real in him is hisparticipation in reality as a whole in proportion as we become more rational this participation isincreased the absolute idea with which the logic ends is something like aristotles god it is thoughtthinking about itself clearly the absolute cannot think about anything but itself since there isnothing else except to our partial and erroneous ways of apprehending reality we are told that spirit is the only reality and that its thought is reflected into itself by selfconsciousness theactual words in which the absolute idea is defined are very obscure wallace translates them asfollows the absolute idea the idea as unity of the subjective and objective idea is the notion of the ideaa notion whose object is the idea as such and for which the objective is ideaan object which embraces all characteristics in its unity 
impossible to reach the truth except by going through all the steps of the dialectic knowledge as a whole has its triadic movement it begins with senseperception in which there isonly awareness of the object then through sceptical criticism of the senses it becomes purelysubjective at last it reaches the stage of selfknowledge in which subject and object are nolonger distinct thus selfconsciousness is the highest form of knowledge this of course mustbe the case in hegels system for the highest kind of knowledge must be that possessed by the absolute and as the absolute is the whole there is nothing outside itself for it to know in the best thinking according to hegel thoughts become fluent and interfuse truth andfalsehood are not sharply defined opposites as is commonly supposed nothing is wholly falseand nothing that we can know is wholly true we can know in a way that is false this happenswhen we attribute absolute truth to some detached piece of information such a question as where was caesar born has a straightforward answer which is true in a sense but not in thephilosophical sense for philosophy the truth is the whole and nothing partial is quite true reason hegel says is the conscious certainty of being all reality this does not mean that aseparate person is all reality in his separateness he is not quite real but what is real in him is hisparticipation in reality as a whole in proportion as we become more rational this participation isincreased the absolute idea with which the logic ends is something like aristotles god it is thoughtthinking about itself clearly the absolute cannot think about anything but itself since there isnothing else except to our partial and erroneous ways of apprehending reality we are told that spirit is the only reality and that its thought is reflected into itself by selfconsciousness theactual words in which the absolute idea is defined are very obscure wallace translates them asfollows the absolute idea the idea as unity of the subjective and objective idea is the notion of the ideaa notion whose object is the idea as such and for which the objective is ideaan object which embraces all characteristics in its unity the original german is even more difficult the essence of the matter is however somewhatless complicated than hegel makes it seem the absolute idea is pure thought thinking aboutpure thought this is all that god does throughout the agestruly a professors god hegel goeson to say this unity is consequently the absolute and all truth the idea which thinks itself i come now to a singular feature of hegels philosophy which distinguishes it from thephilosophy of plato or plotinus or spinoza although ultimate reality is timeless and time ismerely an illusion generated by our inability to see the whole yet the timeprocess has anintimate relation to the purely logical process of the dialectic world history in fact hasadvanced through the categories from pure being in china to the absolute idea which seems to have been nearly if not quite realizedin the prussian state i cannot see any justification on the basis of his own metaphysic for theview that world history repeats the transitions of the dialectic yet that is the thesis which hedeveloped in his philosophy of history it was an interesting thesis giving unity and meaning tothe revolutions of human affairs like other historical theories it required if it was to be madeplausible some distortion of facts and considerable ignorance hegel like marx and spenglerafter him possessed both these qualifications it is odd that a process which is represented ascosmic should all have taken place on our planet and most of it near the mediterranean nor isthere any reason if reality is timeless why the later parts of the process should embody highercategories than the earlier partsunless one were to adopt the blasphemous supposition that the universe was gradually learning hegels philosophy the timeprocess according to hegel is from the less to the more perfect both in an ethicaland in a logical sense indeed these two senses are for him not really distinguishable forlogical perfection consists in being a closelyknit whole without ragged edges withoutindependent parts but united like a human body or still more like a reasonable mind into anorganism whose parts are interdependent and all work together towards a single end and thisalso constitutes  the definition in german is der begriff der idee dem die idee als solche der gegenstand dem das objekt sie ist except in hegel gegenstand and objekt aresynonyms 
the original german is even more difficult the essence of the matter is however somewhatless complicated than hegel makes it seem the absolute idea is pure thought thinking aboutpure thought this is all that god does throughout the agestruly a professors god hegel goeson to say this unity is consequently the absolute and all truth the idea which thinks itself i come now to a singular feature of hegels philosophy which distinguishes it from thephilosophy of plato or plotinus or spinoza although ultimate reality is timeless and time ismerely an illusion generated by our inability to see the whole yet the timeprocess has anintimate relation to the purely logical process of the dialectic world history in fact hasadvanced through the categories from pure being in china to the absolute idea which seems to have been nearly if not quite realizedin the prussian state i cannot see any justification on the basis of his own metaphysic for theview that world history repeats the transitions of the dialectic yet that is the thesis which hedeveloped in his philosophy of history it was an interesting thesis giving unity and meaning tothe revolutions of human affairs like other historical theories it required if it was to be madeplausible some distortion of facts and considerable ignorance hegel like marx and spenglerafter him possessed both these qualifications it is odd that a process which is represented ascosmic should all have taken place on our planet and most of it near the mediterranean nor isthere any reason if reality is timeless why the later parts of the process should embody highercategories than the earlier partsunless one were to adopt the blasphemous supposition that the universe was gradually learning hegels philosophy the timeprocess according to hegel is from the less to the more perfect both in an ethicaland in a logical sense indeed these two senses are for him not really distinguishable forlogical perfection consists in being a closelyknit whole without ragged edges withoutindependent parts but united like a human body or still more like a reasonable mind into anorganism whose parts are interdependent and all work together towards a single end and thisalso constitutes  the definition in german is der begriff der idee dem die idee als solche der gegenstand dem das objekt sie ist except in hegel gegenstand and objekt aresynonyms ethical perfection a few quotations will illustrate hegels theory like the soulconductor mercury the idea is in truth the leader of peoples and of the world and spirit the rational and necessitated will of that conductor is and has been the director of theevents of the worlds history to become acquainted with spirit in this its office of guidance is theobject of our present undertaking the only thought which philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of history is the simpleconception of reason that reason is the sovereign of the world that the history of the worldtherefore presents us with a rational process this conviction and intuition is a hypothesis in thedomain of history as such in that of philosophy it is no hypothesis it is there proved byspeculative cognition that reasonand this term may here suffice us without investigating therelation sustained by the universe to the divine beingis substance as well as infinite power itsown infinite material underlying all the natural and spiritual life which it originates as also the infinite form that which sets the material in motion reason is the substance of the universe that this idea or reason is the true the eternal the absolutely powerful essence that it revealsitself in the world and that in that world nothing else is revealed but this and its honour andgloryis the thesis which as we have said has been proved in philosophy and is here regarded asdemonstrated the world of intelligence and conscious volition is not abandoned to chance but must showitself in the light of the selfcognizant idea this is a result which happens to be known to me because i have traversed the entire field all these quotations are from the introduction to the philosophy of history spirit and the course of its development is the substantial object of the philosophy of history thenature of spirit may be understood by contrasting it with its opposite namely matter the essenceof matter is gravity the essence of spirit is freedom matter is outside itself whereas spirit has itscentre in itself spirit is selfcontained existence if this is not clear the following definitionmay be found more illuminating but what is spirit it is the one immutably homogeneous infinite pure identitywhich in itssecond phase separates itself from itself 
came from miletus introduced him to pericles plato in the phaedrus says pericles fell in it seems with anaxagoras who was a scientific man and satiating himself withthe theory of things on high and having attained to a knowledge of the true nature of intellect andfolly which were just what the discourses of anaxagoras were mainly about he drew from thatsource whatever was of a nature to further him in the art of speech it is said that anaxagoras also influenced euripides but this is more doubtful the citizens of athens like those of other cities in other ages and continents showed a certainhostility to those who attempted to introduce a higher level of culture than that to which they wereaccustomed when pericles was growing old his opponents began a campaign against him byattacking his friends they accused pheidias of embezzling some of the gold that was to beemployed on his statues they passed a law permitting impeachment of those who did not practisereligion and taught theories about the things on high under this law they prosecuted anaxagoras who was accused of teaching that the sun was a redhot stone and the moon wasearth what happened is not certain except that he had to leave athens it seemsprobable that pericles got him out of prison and managed to get him away he returned to ioniawhere he founded a school in accordance with his will the anniversary of his death was kept as aschoolchildrens holiday anaxagoras held that everything is infinitely divisible and that even the smallest portion of mattercontains some of each element things appear to be that of which they contain most thus forexample everything contains some fire but we only call it fire if that element preponderates like empedocles he argues against the void saying that the clepsydra or an inflated skin shows thatthere is air where there seems to be nothing he differed from his predecessors in regarding mind as a substance which enters into thecomposition of living things and distinguishes them from dead matter in everything he saysthere is a portion of everything except mind and some things contain mind also mind has power overall things that have life it is infinite and selfruled and is mixed with nothing except as regardsmind everything however small contains portions of all opposites such as hot and cold whiteand black he maintained that snow is black mind is the source of all motion it causes a rotation which is gradually spreading throughout theworld and is causing the lightest things to go to the circumference and the heaviest to falltowards the centre mind is uniform and is just as good in animals as in man mans apparentsuperiority is due to the fact that he has hands all seeming differences of intelligence are reallydue to bodily differences both aristotle and the platonic socrates complain that anaxagoras after introducing mind makesvery little use of it aristotle points out that he only introduces mind as a cause when he knows noother whenever he can he gives a mechanical explanation he rejected necessity and chance asgiving the origins of things nevertheless there was no providence in his cosmology he doesnot seem to have thought much about ethics or religion probably he was an atheist as hisprosecutors maintained all his predecessors influenced him except pythagoras the influence of parmenides was the same in his case as in that of empedocles in science he had great merit it was he who first explained that the moon shines by reflected lightthough there is a cryptic fragment in parmenides suggesting that he also knew this anaxagorasgave the correct theory of eclipses and knew that the moon is below the sun the sun and stars hesaid are fiery stones but we do not feel the heat of the stars because they are too distant the sunis larger than the peloponnesus the moon has mountains and inhabitants anaxagoras is said to have been of the school of anaximenes certainly he kept alive therationalist and scientific tradition of the ionians one does not find in him the ethical and religiouspreoccupations which passing from the pythagoreans to socrates and from socrates to platobrought an obscurantist bias into greek philosophy he is not quite in the first rank but he isimportant as the first to bring philosophy to athens and as one of the influences that helped toform socrates

contrary he says that america is the land of the future where in the ages that lie before us theburden of the worlds history shall reveal itselfperhaps he adds characteristically in a contestbetween north and south america he seems to think that everything important takes the form ofwar if it were suggested to him that the contribution of america to world history might be thedevelopment of a society without extreme poverty he would not be interested on the contrary hesays that as yet there is no real state in america because a real state requires a division ofclasses into rich and poor nations in hegel play the part that classes play in marx the principle of historical developmenthe says is national genius in every age there is some one nation which is charged with themission of carrying the world through the stage of the dialectic that it has reached in our age ofcourse this nation is germany but in addition to nations we must also take account of worldhistorical individuals these are men in whose aims are embodied the dialectical transitions thatare due to take place in their time these men are heroes and may justifiably contravene ordinarymoral rules alexander caesar and napoleon are given as examples i doubt whether in hegelsopinion a man could be a hero without being a military conqueror hegels emphasis on nations together with his peculiar conception of freedom explains hisglorification of the statea very important aspect of his political philosophy to which we mustnow turn our attention his philosophy of the state is developed both in his philosophy of historyand in his philosophy of law it is in the main compatible with his general metaphysic but notnecessitated by it at certain points howevereg as regards the relations between stateshisadmiration of the national state is carried so far as to become inconsistent with his generalpreference of wholes to parts glorification of the state begins so far as modern times are concerned with the reformation inthe roman empire the emperor was deified and the state thereby acquired a sacred characterbut the philosophers of the middle ages with few exceptions were ecclesiastics and thereforeput the church above the state luther finding support in protestant princes began the oppositepractice the lutheran church on the whole was erastian hobbes who was politically a protestant developed the doctrine of the supremacy of the state and spinoza on the wholeagreed with him rousseau as we have seen thought the state should not tolerate other political organizations hegel wasvehemently protestant of the lutheran section the prussian state was an erastian absolutemonarchy these reasons would make one expect to find the state highly valued by hegel buteven so he goes to lengths which are astonishing we are told in the philosophy of history that the state is the actually existing realized morallife and that all the spiritual reality possessed by a human being he possesses only through the state for his spiritual reality consists in this that his own essencereasonis objectivelypresent to him that it possesses objective immediate existence for him  for truth is the unityof the universal and subjective will and the universal is to be found in the state in its laws itsuniversal and rational arrangements the state is the divine idea as its exists on earth againthe state is the embodiment of rational freedom realizing and recognizing itself in an objectiveform  the state is the idea of spirit in the external manifestation of human will and its freedom the philosophy of law in the section on the state develops the same doctrine somewhat morefully the state is the reality of the moral ideathe moral spirit as the visible substantial willevident to itself which thinks and knows itself and fulfils what it knows in so far as it knows itthe state is the rational in and for itself if the state existed only for the interests of individuals an individual might or might not be a member of the state it has howevera quite different relation to the individual since it is objective spirit the individual only hasobjectivity truth and morality in so far as he is a member of the state whose true content andpurpose is union as such it is admitted that there may be bad states but these merely exist andhave no true reality whereas a rational state is infinite in itself it will be seen that hegel claims for the state much the same position as saint augustine and his catholic successors claimed for the church there are however two respects in which the catholic claim is more reasonable than hegels in the first place the church is not a chancegeographical association but a body united by a common creed believed by its members to be ofsupreme importance it is thus in its very essence the embodiment of what hegel calls the ideain the second place there is only one catholic church whereas 
we have seen thought the state should not tolerate other political organizations hegel wasvehemently protestant of the lutheran section the prussian state was an erastian absolutemonarchy these reasons would make one expect to find the state highly valued by hegel buteven so he goes to lengths which are astonishing we are told in the philosophy of history that the state is the actually existing realized morallife and that all the spiritual reality possessed by a human being he possesses only through the state for his spiritual reality consists in this that his own essencereasonis objectivelypresent to him that it possesses objective immediate existence for him  for truth is the unityof the universal and subjective will and the universal is to be found in the state in its laws itsuniversal and rational arrangements the state is the divine idea as its exists on earth againthe state is the embodiment of rational freedom realizing and recognizing itself in an objectiveform  the state is the idea of spirit in the external manifestation of human will and its freedom the philosophy of law in the section on the state develops the same doctrine somewhat morefully the state is the reality of the moral ideathe moral spirit as the visible substantial willevident to itself which thinks and knows itself and fulfils what it knows in so far as it knows itthe state is the rational in and for itself if the state existed only for the interests of individuals an individual might or might not be a member of the state it has howevera quite different relation to the individual since it is objective spirit the individual only hasobjectivity truth and morality in so far as he is a member of the state whose true content andpurpose is union as such it is admitted that there may be bad states but these merely exist andhave no true reality whereas a rational state is infinite in itself it will be seen that hegel claims for the state much the same position as saint augustine and his catholic successors claimed for the church there are however two respects in which the catholic claim is more reasonable than hegels in the first place the church is not a chancegeographical association but a body united by a common creed believed by its members to be ofsupreme importance it is thus in its very essence the embodiment of what hegel calls the ideain the second place there is only one catholic church whereas there are many states when each state in relation to its subjects is made as absolute as hegelmakes it there is difficulty in finding any philosophical principle by which to regulate therelations between different states in fact at this point hegel abandons his philosophical talkfalling back on the state of nature and hobbess war of all against all the habit of speaking of the state as if there were only one is misleading so long as there is noworld state duty being for hegel solely a relation of the individual to his state no principle isleft by which to moralize the relations between states this hegel recognizes in externalrelations he says the state is an individual and each state is independent as against the otherssince in this independence the beingforself of real spirit has its existence it is the first freedomand highest honour of a people he goes on to argue against any sort of league of nations bywhich the independence of separate states might be limited the duty of a citizen is entirelyconfined to upholding the substantialindividuality and independence and sovereignty of his own state it follows that war is not whollyan evil or something that we should seek to abolish the purpose of the state is not merely touphold the life and property of the citizens and this fact provides the moral justification of warwhich is not to be regarded as an absolute evil or as accidental or as having its cause in somethingthat ought not to be hegel does not mean only that in some situations a nation cannot rightly avoid going to war hemeans much more than this he is opposed to the creation of institutionssuch as a worldgovernment which would prevent such situations from arising because he thinks it a good thingthat there should be wars from time to time war he says is the condition in which we takeseriously the vanity of temporal goods and things war has a positive moral value war has the highersignificance that through it the moral health of peoples is preserved in their indifference towardsthe stabilizing of finite determinations peace is ossification the holy alliance and kants league for peace are mistaken because a family of states needs an enemy conflicts of statescan only be decided by war states being towards each other in a state of nature their relations 
there are many states when each state in relation to its subjects is made as absolute as hegelmakes it there is difficulty in finding any philosophical principle by which to regulate therelations between different states in fact at this point hegel abandons his philosophical talkfalling back on the state of nature and hobbess war of all against all the habit of speaking of the state as if there were only one is misleading so long as there is noworld state duty being for hegel solely a relation of the individual to his state no principle isleft by which to moralize the relations between states this hegel recognizes in externalrelations he says the state is an individual and each state is independent as against the otherssince in this independence the beingforself of real spirit has its existence it is the first freedomand highest honour of a people he goes on to argue against any sort of league of nations bywhich the independence of separate states might be limited the duty of a citizen is entirelyconfined to upholding the substantialindividuality and independence and sovereignty of his own state it follows that war is not whollyan evil or something that we should seek to abolish the purpose of the state is not merely touphold the life and property of the citizens and this fact provides the moral justification of warwhich is not to be regarded as an absolute evil or as accidental or as having its cause in somethingthat ought not to be hegel does not mean only that in some situations a nation cannot rightly avoid going to war hemeans much more than this he is opposed to the creation of institutionssuch as a worldgovernment which would prevent such situations from arising because he thinks it a good thingthat there should be wars from time to time war he says is the condition in which we takeseriously the vanity of temporal goods and things war has a positive moral value war has the highersignificance that through it the moral health of peoples is preserved in their indifference towardsthe stabilizing of finite determinations peace is ossification the holy alliance and kants league for peace are mistaken because a family of states needs an enemy conflicts of statescan only be decided by war states being towards each other in a state of nature their relations are not legal or moral their rights have their reality in their particular wills and the interest ofeach state is its own highest law there is no contrast of morals and politics because states arenot subject to ordinary moral laws such is hegels doctrine of the statea doctrine which if accepted justifies every internal tyrannyand every external aggression that can possibly be imagined the strength of his bias appears inthe fact that his theory is largely inconsistent with his own metaphysic and that theinconsistencies are all such as tend to the justification of cruelty and international brigandage aman may be pardoned if logic compels him regretfully to reach conclusions which he deploresbut not for departing from logic in order to be free to advocate crimes hegels logic led him tobelieve that there is more reality or excellence in wholes than intheir parts and that a whole increases in reality and excellence as it becomes more organized thisjustified him in preferring a state to an anarchic collection of individuals but it should equallyhave led him to prefer a world state to an anarchic collection of states within the state hisgeneral philosophy should have led him to feel more respect for the individual than he did feel forthe wholes of which his logic treats are not like the one of parmenides or even like spinozas god they are wholes in which the individual does not disappear but acquires fuller realitythrough his harmonious relation to a larger organism a state in which the individual is ignored isnot a smallscale model of the hegelian absolute nor is there any good reason in hegels metaphysic for the exclusive emphasis on the state asopposed to other social organizations i can see nothing but protestant bias in his preference of the state to the church moreover if it is good that society should be as organic as possible as hegelbelieves then many social organizations are necessary in addition to the state and the church itshould follow from hegels principles that every interest which is not harmful to the communityand which can be promoted by cooperation should have its appropriate organization and thatevery such organization should have its quota of limited independence it may be objected thatultimate authority must reside somewhere and cannot reside elsewhere than in the state but evenso it may be desirable that this 
are not legal or moral their rights have their reality in their particular wills and the interest ofeach state is its own highest law there is no contrast of morals and politics because states arenot subject to ordinary moral laws such is hegels doctrine of the statea doctrine which if accepted justifies every internal tyrannyand every external aggression that can possibly be imagined the strength of his bias appears inthe fact that his theory is largely inconsistent with his own metaphysic and that theinconsistencies are all such as tend to the justification of cruelty and international brigandage aman may be pardoned if logic compels him regretfully to reach conclusions which he deploresbut not for departing from logic in order to be free to advocate crimes hegels logic led him tobelieve that there is more reality or excellence in wholes than intheir parts and that a whole increases in reality and excellence as it becomes more organized thisjustified him in preferring a state to an anarchic collection of individuals but it should equallyhave led him to prefer a world state to an anarchic collection of states within the state hisgeneral philosophy should have led him to feel more respect for the individual than he did feel forthe wholes of which his logic treats are not like the one of parmenides or even like spinozas god they are wholes in which the individual does not disappear but acquires fuller realitythrough his harmonious relation to a larger organism a state in which the individual is ignored isnot a smallscale model of the hegelian absolute nor is there any good reason in hegels metaphysic for the exclusive emphasis on the state asopposed to other social organizations i can see nothing but protestant bias in his preference of the state to the church moreover if it is good that society should be as organic as possible as hegelbelieves then many social organizations are necessary in addition to the state and the church itshould follow from hegels principles that every interest which is not harmful to the communityand which can be promoted by cooperation should have its appropriate organization and thatevery such organization should have its quota of limited independence it may be objected thatultimate authority must reside somewhere and cannot reside elsewhere than in the state but evenso it may be desirable that this ultimate authority should not be irresistible when it attempts to be oppressive beyond a point this brings us to a question which is fundamental in judging hegels whole philosophy is theremore reality and is there more value in a whole than in its parts hegel answers both questions inthe affirmative the question of reality is metaphysical the question of value is ethical they arecommonly treated as if they were scarcely distinguishable but to my mind it is important to keepthem apart let us begin with the metaphysical question the view of hegel and of many other philosophers is that the character of any portion of theuniverse is so profoundly affected by its relations to the other parts and to the whole that no truestatement can be made about any part except to assign its place in the whole since its place in thewhole depends upon all the other parts a true statement about its place in the whole will at thesame time assign the place of every other part in the whole thus there can be only one truestatement there is no truth except the whole truth and similarly nothing is quite real except thewhole for any part when isolated is changed in character by being isolated and therefore nolonger appears quite what it truly is on the other hand when a part is viewed in relation to thewhole as it should be it is seen to be not selfsubsistent and to be incapable of existing except aspart of just that whole which alone is truly real this is the metaphysical doctrine the ethical doctrine which maintains that value resides in the whole rather than in the parts mustbe true if the metaphysical doctrine is true but need not be false if the metaphysical doctrine isfalse it may moreover be true of some wholes and not of others it is obviously true in somesense of a living body the eye is worthless when separated from the body a collection ofdisjecta membra even when complete has not the value that once belonged to the body fromwhich they were taken hegel conceives the ethical relation of the citizen to the state as analogousto that of the eye to the body in his place the citizen is part of a valuable whole but isolated he isas useless as an isolated eye the analogy however is open to question from the ethicalimportance of some wholes that of all wholes does not follow the above statement of the ethical problem is defective in one im 
ultimate authority should not be irresistible when it attempts to be oppressive beyond a point this brings us to a question which is fundamental in judging hegels whole philosophy is theremore reality and is there more value in a whole than in its parts hegel answers both questions inthe affirmative the question of reality is metaphysical the question of value is ethical they arecommonly treated as if they were scarcely distinguishable but to my mind it is important to keepthem apart let us begin with the metaphysical question the view of hegel and of many other philosophers is that the character of any portion of theuniverse is so profoundly affected by its relations to the other parts and to the whole that no truestatement can be made about any part except to assign its place in the whole since its place in thewhole depends upon all the other parts a true statement about its place in the whole will at thesame time assign the place of every other part in the whole thus there can be only one truestatement there is no truth except the whole truth and similarly nothing is quite real except thewhole for any part when isolated is changed in character by being isolated and therefore nolonger appears quite what it truly is on the other hand when a part is viewed in relation to thewhole as it should be it is seen to be not selfsubsistent and to be incapable of existing except aspart of just that whole which alone is truly real this is the metaphysical doctrine the ethical doctrine which maintains that value resides in the whole rather than in the parts mustbe true if the metaphysical doctrine is true but need not be false if the metaphysical doctrine isfalse it may moreover be true of some wholes and not of others it is obviously true in somesense of a living body the eye is worthless when separated from the body a collection ofdisjecta membra even when complete has not the value that once belonged to the body fromwhich they were taken hegel conceives the ethical relation of the citizen to the state as analogousto that of the eye to the body in his place the citizen is part of a valuable whole but isolated he isas useless as an isolated eye the analogy however is open to question from the ethicalimportance of some wholes that of all wholes does not follow the above statement of the ethical problem is defective in one im portant respect namely that it does not take account of the distinction between ends and means an eye in a living body is useful that is to say it has value as a means but it has no moreintrinsic value than when detached from the body a thing has intrinsic value when it is prized forits own sake not as a means to something else we value the eye as a means to seeing seeingmay be a means or an end it is a means when it shows us food or enemies it is an end when itshows us something that we find beautiful the state is obviously valuable as a means it protectsus against thieves and murderers it provides roads and schools and so on it may of course alsobe bad as a means for example by waging an unjust war the real question we have to ask inconnection with hegel is not this but whether the state is good per se as an end do the citizensexist for the sake of the state or the state for the sake of the citizens hegel holds the formerview the liberal philosophy that comes from locke holds the latter it is clear that we shall onlyattribute intrinsic value to the state if we think of it as having a life of its own as being in somesense a person at this point hegels metaphysic becomes relevant to the question of value aperson is a complex whole having a single life can there be a superperson composed of personsas the body is composed of organs and having a single life which is not the sum of the lives of thecomponent persons if there can be such a superperson as hegel thinks then the state may besuch a being and it may be as superior to ourselves as the whole body is to the eye but if wethink this superperson a mere metaphysical monstrosity then we shall say that the intrinsic valueof a community is derived from that of its members and that the state is a means not an end weare thus brought back from the ethical to the metaphysical question the metaphysical questionitself we shall find is really a question of logic the question at issue is much wider than the truth or falsehood of hegels philosophy it is thequestion that divides the friends of analysis from its enemies let us take an illustration suppose isay john is the father of james hegel and all who believe in what marshal smuts callsholism will say before you can understand this statement you must know who john and james are now to know who john is is to know all his characteristics for apart from them hewould not be distinguishable from any one else but all his characteristics involve other people orthings he is characterized by 
portant respect namely that it does not take account of the distinction between ends and means an eye in a living body is useful that is to say it has value as a means but it has no moreintrinsic value than when detached from the body a thing has intrinsic value when it is prized forits own sake not as a means to something else we value the eye as a means to seeing seeingmay be a means or an end it is a means when it shows us food or enemies it is an end when itshows us something that we find beautiful the state is obviously valuable as a means it protectsus against thieves and murderers it provides roads and schools and so on it may of course alsobe bad as a means for example by waging an unjust war the real question we have to ask inconnection with hegel is not this but whether the state is good per se as an end do the citizensexist for the sake of the state or the state for the sake of the citizens hegel holds the formerview the liberal philosophy that comes from locke holds the latter it is clear that we shall onlyattribute intrinsic value to the state if we think of it as having a life of its own as being in somesense a person at this point hegels metaphysic becomes relevant to the question of value aperson is a complex whole having a single life can there be a superperson composed of personsas the body is composed of organs and having a single life which is not the sum of the lives of thecomponent persons if there can be such a superperson as hegel thinks then the state may besuch a being and it may be as superior to ourselves as the whole body is to the eye but if wethink this superperson a mere metaphysical monstrosity then we shall say that the intrinsic valueof a community is derived from that of its members and that the state is a means not an end weare thus brought back from the ethical to the metaphysical question the metaphysical questionitself we shall find is really a question of logic the question at issue is much wider than the truth or falsehood of hegels philosophy it is thequestion that divides the friends of analysis from its enemies let us take an illustration suppose isay john is the father of james hegel and all who believe in what marshal smuts callsholism will say before you can understand this statement you must know who john and james are now to know who john is is to know all his characteristics for apart from them hewould not be distinguishable from any one else but all his characteristics involve other people orthings he is characterized by his relations to his parents his wife and his children by whether he is a good or a bad citizen andby the country to which he belongs all these things you must know before you can be said toknow whom the word john refers to step by step in your endeavour to say what you mean bythe word john you will be led to take account of the whole universe and your original statementwill turn out to be telling you something about the universe not about two separate people johnand james now this is all very well but it is open to an initial objection if the above argument were soundhow could knowledge ever begin i know numbers of propositions of the form a is the father of b but i do not know the whole universe if all knowledge were knowledge of the universe as awhole there would be no knowledge this is enough to make us suspect a mistake somewhere the fact is that in order to use the word john correctly and intelligently i do not need to knowall about john but only enough to recognize him no doubt he has relations near or remote toeverything in the universe but he can be spoken of truly without taking them into account exceptsuch as are the direct subjectmatter of what is being said he may be the father of jemima as wellas of james but it is not necessary for me to know this in order to know that he is the father of james if hegel were right we could not state fully what is meant by john is the father of jameswithout mentioning jemima we ought to say john the father of jemima is the father of jamesthis would still be inadequate we should have to go on to mention his parents and grandparentsand a whole whos who but this lands us in absurdities the hegelian position might be stated asfollows the word john means all that is true of john but as a definition this is circular sincethe word john occurs in the defining phrase in fact if hegel were right no word could begin tohave a meaning since we should need to know already the meanings of all other words in order tostate all the properties of what the word designates which according to the theory are what theword means to put the matter abstractly we must distinguish properties of different kinds a thing may have aproperty not involving any other thing this sort is called a quality or it may have a propertyinvolving one other thing such a property is being married or it may have one involving twoother things such as being a brotherinlaw if a

chapter ix the atomists the founders of atomism were two leucippus and democritus it is difficult to disentanglethem because they are generally mentioned together and apparently some of the works of leucippus were subsequently attributed to democritus leucippus who seems to haveflourished about bc came from miletus and carried on the scientific rationalistphilosophy associated with that city he was much influenced by parmenides and zeno so littleis known of him that epicurus was thought to have denied hisexistence altogether and some moderns have revived this theory there are however a numberof allusions to him in aristotle and it seems incredible that these would have occurred if he had been merely a myth democritus is a much more definite figure he was a native of abdera in thrace as for hisdate he stated that he was young when anaxagoras was old say about bc and he is takento have flourished about bc he travelled widely in southern and eastern lands in search ofknowledge he perhaps spent a considerable time in egypt and he certainly visited persia hethen returned to abdera where he remained zeller calls him superior to all earlier andcontemporary philosophers in wealth of knowledge and to most in acuteness and logicalcorrectness of thinking democritus was a contemporary of socrates and the sophists and should on purelychronological grounds be treated somewhat later in our history the difficulty is that he is sohard to separate from leucippus on this ground i am considering him before socrates  cyril bailey the greek atomists and epicurus estimates that he flourished about bc or a little earlier and the sophists although part of his philosophy was intended as an answer to protagoras hisfellowtownsman and the most eminent of the sophists protagoras when he visited athenswas received enthusiastically democritus on the other hand says i went to athens and noone knew me for a long time his philosophy was ignored in athens it is not clear says burnet that plato knew anything about democritus  aristotle on the other hand knows democritus well for he too was an ionian from the north plato never mentions him in the dialogues but is said by diogenes laertius to have disliked him so much that he wished all hisbooks burnt heath esteems him highly as a mathematician the fundamental ideas of the common philosophy of leucippus and democritus were due tothe former but as regards the working out it is hardly possible to disentangle them nor is it forour purposes important to make the attempt leucippus if not democritus was led to atomismin the attempt to mediate between monism and pluralism as represented by parmenides and empedocles respectively their point of view was remarkably like that of modern science andavoided most of the faults to which greek speculation was prone they believed that everythingis composed of atoms which are physically but not geometrically indivisible that between theatoms there is empty space that atoms are indestructible that they always have been andalways will be in motion that there are an infinite number of atoms and even of kinds ofatoms the differences being as regards shape and size aristotle asserts that according tothe atomists atoms also differ as regards heat the spherical atoms which compose fire beingthe hottest and as regards weight he quotes democritus as saying the more any indivisibleexceeds the heavier it is but the question whether atoms are originally possessed of weight inthe theories of the atomists is a controversial one the atoms were always in motion but there is disagreement among commentators as to thecharacter of the original motion some especially zeller hold that the atoms were thought to bealways falling and that the heavier ones fell faster they thus caught up the lighter ones therewere impacts and the atoms were deflected like billiard  from thales to plato p greek mathematics vol i p  on generation and corruption

very sincere the mystics to whom he appeals believed in contemplation in the beatific visionthe most profound kind of knowledge was to be achieved and this kind of knowledge was thesupreme good ever since parmenides the delusive knowledge of appearance was contrastedwith another kind of knowledge not with something of a wholly different kind christianityteaches that in knowledge of god standeth our eternal life but schopenhauer will have none ofthis he agrees that what commonly passes for knowledge belongs to the realm of maya butwhen we pierce the veil we behold not god but satan the wicked omnipotent will perpetuallybusied in weaving a web of suffering for the torture of its creatures terrified by the diabolic vision the sage cries avaunt and seeks refuge in nonexistence it is an insult to the mysticsto claim them as believers in this mythology and the suggestion that without achievingcomplete nonexistence the sage may yet live a life having some value is not possible toreconcile with schopenhauers pessimism so long as the sage exists he exists because heretains will which is evil he may diminish the quantity of evil by weakening his will but hecan never acquire any positive good nor is the doctrine sincere if we may judge by schopenhauers life he habitually dined well ata good restaurant he had many trivial loveaffairs which were sensual but not passionate hewas exceedingly quarrelsome and unusually avaricious on one occasion he was annoyed by anelderly seamstress who was talking to a friend outside the door of his apartment he threw herdownstairs causing her permanent injury she obtained a court order compelling him to pay hera certain sum every quarter as long as she lived when at last she died after twentyyears he noted in his accountbook obit anus abit

moral bias platoespecially is condemned on account of his taste for edification nietzsche however obviouslydoes not quite like condemning him and suggests to excuse him that perhaps he was insincereand only preached virtue as a means of keeping the lower classes in order he speaks of him onone occasion as a great cagliostro he likes democritus and epicurus but his affection for thelatter seems somewhat illogical unless it is interpreted as really an admiration for lucretius as might be expected he has a low opinion of kant whom he calls a moral fanatic la rousseau in spite of nietzsches criticism of the romantics his outlook owes much to them it is that ofaristocratic anarchism like byrons and one is not surprised to find him admiring byron heattempts to combine two sets of values which are not easily harmonized on the one hand he likesruthlessness war and aristocratic pride on the other hand he loves philosophy and literature andthe arts especially music historically these values coexisted in the renaissance pope julius iifighting for bologna and employing michelangelo might be taken as the sort of man whom nietzsche would wish to see in control of governments it is natural to compare nietzsche with machiavelli in spite of important differences between the two men as for the differences machiavelli was a man of affairs whose opinions had been formed by close contact with publicbusiness and were in harmony with his age he was not pedantic or systematic and his philosophyof politics scarcely forms a coherent whole nietzsche on the contrary was a professor anessentially bookish man and a philosopher in conscious opposition to what appeared to be thedominant political and ethical trends of his time the similarities however go deeper

and the sophists although part of his philosophy was intended as an answer to protagoras hisfellowtownsman and the most eminent of the sophists protagoras when he visited athenswas received enthusiastically democritus on the other hand says i went to athens and noone knew me for a long time his philosophy was ignored in athens it is not clear says burnet that plato knew anything about democritus  aristotle on the other hand knows democritus well for he too was an ionian from the north plato never mentions him in the dialogues but is said by diogenes laertius to have disliked him so much that he wished all hisbooks burnt heath esteems him highly as a mathematician the fundamental ideas of the common philosophy of leucippus and democritus were due tothe former but as regards the working out it is hardly possible to disentangle them nor is it forour purposes important to make the attempt leucippus if not democritus was led to atomismin the attempt to mediate between monism and pluralism as represented by parmenides and empedocles respectively their point of view was remarkably like that of modern science andavoided most of the faults to which greek speculation was prone they believed that everythingis composed of atoms which are physically but not geometrically indivisible that between theatoms there is empty space that atoms are indestructible that they always have been andalways will be in motion that there are an infinite number of atoms and even of kinds ofatoms the differences being as regards shape and size aristotle asserts that according tothe atomists atoms also differ as regards heat the spherical atoms which compose fire beingthe hottest and as regards weight he quotes democritus as saying the more any indivisibleexceeds the heavier it is but the question whether atoms are originally possessed of weight inthe theories of the atomists is a controversial one the atoms were always in motion but there is disagreement among commentators as to thecharacter of the original motion some especially zeller hold that the atoms were thought to bealways falling and that the heavier ones fell faster they thus caught up the lighter ones therewere impacts and the atoms were deflected like billiard  from thales to plato p greek mathematics vol i p  on generation and corruption  balls this was certainly the view of epicurus who in most respects based his theories on thoseof democritus while trying rather unintelligently to take account of aristotles criticisms butthere is considerable reason to think that weight was not an original property of the atoms of leucippus and democritus it seems more probable that on their view atoms were originallymoving at random as in the modern kinetic theory of gases democritus said there was neitherup nor down in the infinite void and compared the movement of atoms in the soul to that ofmotes in a sunbeam when there is no wind this is a much more intelligent view than that of epicurus and i think we may assume it to have been that of leucippus and democritus as a result of collisions collections of atoms came to form vortices the rest proceeded muchas in anaxagoras but it was an advance to explain the vortices mechanically rather than as dueto the action of mind it was common in antiquity to reproach the atomists with attributing everything to chance theywere on the contrary strict determinists who believed that everything happens in accordancewith natural laws democritus explicitly denied that anything can happen by chance leucippus though his existence is questioned is known to have said one thing naughthappens for nothing but everything from a ground and of necessity it is true that he gave noreason why the world should originally have been as it was this perhaps might have beenattributed to chance but when once the world existed its further development was unalterablyfixed by mechanical principles aristotle and others reproached him and democritus for notaccounting for the original motion of the atoms but in this the atomists were more scientificthan their critics causation must start from something and wherever it starts no cause can beassigned for the initial datum the world may be attributed to a creator but even then the creator himself is unaccounted for the theory of the atomists in fact was more nearly that ofmodern science than any other theory propounded in antiquity the atomists unlike socrates plato and aristotle sought to ex  this interpretation is adopted by burnet and also at least as regards leucippus by bailey see bailey op cit p on the determinism of democritus

real world has become very like his nightmare but that does not make it any the less horrible it must be admitted that there is a certain type of christian ethic to which nietzsches stricturescan be justly applied pascal and dostoevskyhis own illustrationshave both something abject intheir virtue pascal sacrificed his magnificent mathematical intellect to his god thereby attributingto him a barbarity which was a cosmic enlargement of pascals morbid mental tortures dostoevsky would have nothing to do with proper pride he would sin in order to repent and toenjoy the luxury of confession i will not argue the question how far such aberrations can justly becharged against christianity but i will admit that i agree with nietzsche in thinking dostoevskysprostration contemptible a certain uprightness and pride and even selfassertion of a sort ishould agree are elements in the best character no virtue which has its roots in fear is much to beadmired there are two sorts of saints the saint by nature and the saint from fear the saint by nature has aspontaneous love of mankind he does good because to do so gives him happiness the saint fromfear on the other hand like the man who only abstains from theft because of the police would bewicked if he were not restrained by the thought of hellfire or of his neighbours vengeance nietzsche can only imagine the second sort of saint he is so full of fear and hatred thatspontaneous love of mankind seems to him impossible he has never conceived of the man whowith all the fearlessness and stubborn pride of the superman nevertheless does not inflict painbecause he has no wish to do so does any one suppose that lincoln acted as he did from fear ofhell yet to nietzsche lincoln is abject napoleon magnificent it remains to consider the main ethical problem raised by nietzsche namely should our ethic bearistocratic or should it in some sense treat all men alike this is a question which as i have juststated it has no very clear meaning and obviously the first step is to try to make the issue moredefinite we must in the first place try to distinguish an aristocratic ethic from an aristocratic politicaltheory a believer in benthams principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number has ademocratic ethic but he may think that the general happiness is best promoted by an aristocraticform of government this is not nietzsches posi tion he holds that the happiness of common people is no part of the good per se all that is goodor bad in itself exists only in the superior few what happens to the rest is of no account the next question is how are the superior few defined in practice they have usually been aconquering race or a hereditary aristocracy and aristocracies have usually been at least in theorydescendants of conquering races i think nietzsche would accept this definition no morality ispossible without good birth he tells us he says that the noble caste is always at first barbarianbut that every elevation of man is due to aristocratic society it is not clear whether nietzsche regards the superiority of the aristocrat as congenital or as due toeducation and environment if the latter it is difficult to defend the exclusion of others fromadvantages for which ex hypothesi they are equally qualified i shall therefore assume that heregards conquering aristocracies and their descendants as biologically superior to their subjects asmen are superior to domestic animals though in a lesser degree what shall we mean by biologically superior we shall mean when interpreting nietzsche thatindividuals of the superior race and their descendants are more likely to be noble in nietzschessense they will have more strength of will more courage more impulse towards power lesssympathy less fear and less gentleness we can now state nietzsches ethic i think what follows is a fair analysis of it victors in war and their descendants are usually biologically superior to the vanquished it istherefore desirable that they should hold all the power and should manage affairs exclusively intheir own interests there is here still the word desirable to be considered what is desirable in nietzschesphilosophy from the outsiders point of view what nietzsche calls desirable is what nietzschedesires with this interpretation nietzsches doctrine might be stated more simply and honestly inthe one sentence i wish i had lived in the athens of pericles or the florence of the medici butthis is not a philosophy it is a biographical fact about a certain individual the word desirable isnot synonymous with desired by me it has some claim however shadowy to legislativeuniversality a theist may say that what is desirable is what god desires but nietzsche cannot saythis 
tion he holds that the happiness of common people is no part of the good per se all that is goodor bad in itself exists only in the superior few what happens to the rest is of no account the next question is how are the superior few defined in practice they have usually been aconquering race or a hereditary aristocracy and aristocracies have usually been at least in theorydescendants of conquering races i think nietzsche would accept this definition no morality ispossible without good birth he tells us he says that the noble caste is always at first barbarianbut that every elevation of man is due to aristocratic society it is not clear whether nietzsche regards the superiority of the aristocrat as congenital or as due toeducation and environment if the latter it is difficult to defend the exclusion of others fromadvantages for which ex hypothesi they are equally qualified i shall therefore assume that heregards conquering aristocracies and their descendants as biologically superior to their subjects asmen are superior to domestic animals though in a lesser degree what shall we mean by biologically superior we shall mean when interpreting nietzsche thatindividuals of the superior race and their descendants are more likely to be noble in nietzschessense they will have more strength of will more courage more impulse towards power lesssympathy less fear and less gentleness we can now state nietzsches ethic i think what follows is a fair analysis of it victors in war and their descendants are usually biologically superior to the vanquished it istherefore desirable that they should hold all the power and should manage affairs exclusively intheir own interests there is here still the word desirable to be considered what is desirable in nietzschesphilosophy from the outsiders point of view what nietzsche calls desirable is what nietzschedesires with this interpretation nietzsches doctrine might be stated more simply and honestly inthe one sentence i wish i had lived in the athens of pericles or the florence of the medici butthis is not a philosophy it is a biographical fact about a certain individual the word desirable isnot synonymous with desired by me it has some claim however shadowy to legislativeuniversality a theist may say that what is desirable is what god desires but nietzsche cannot saythis he could say that he knows what is good by an ethical intuition but he will not say this because itsounds too kantian what he can say as an expansion of the word desirable is this if men willread my works a certain percentage of them will come to share my desires as regards theorganization of society these men inspired by the energy and determination which my philosophywill give them can preserve and restore aristocracy with themselves as aristocrats or sycophants of aristocracy in this way they will achieve a fuller life than they can have as servantsof the people there is another element in nietzsche which is closely akin to the objection urged by ruggedindividualists against tradeunions in a fight of all against all the victor is likely to possesscertain qualities which nietzsche admires such as courage resourcefulness and strength of will but if the men who do not possess these aristocratic qualities bandthemselves together they may win in spite of their individual inferiority in this fight of thecollective canaille against the aristocrats christianity is the ideological front as the french revolution was the fighting front we ought therefore to oppose every kind of union among theindividually feeble for fear lest their combined power should outweigh that of the individuallystrong on the other hand we ought to promote union among the tough and virile elements of thepopulation the first step towards the creation of such a union is the preaching of nietzschesphilosophy it will be seen that it is not easy to preserve the distinction between ethics andpolitics suppose we wishas i certainly doto find arguments against nietzsches ethics and politics whatarguments can we find there are weighty practical arguments showing that the attempt to secure his ends will in factsecure something quite different aristocracies of birth are nowadays discredited the onlypracticable form of aristocracy is an organization like the fascist or the nazi party such anorganization rouses opposition and is likely to be defeated in war but if it is not defeated it mustbefore long become nothing but a police state where the rulers live in terror of assassination andthe heroes are in concentration camps in such a community faith and honour are sapped bydelation and the wouldbe aristocracy of supermen degenerates into a clique of tremblingpoltroons these however are arguments for our time they would not have 
he could say that he knows what is good by an ethical intuition but he will not say this because itsounds too kantian what he can say as an expansion of the word desirable is this if men willread my works a certain percentage of them will come to share my desires as regards theorganization of society these men inspired by the energy and determination which my philosophywill give them can preserve and restore aristocracy with themselves as aristocrats or sycophants of aristocracy in this way they will achieve a fuller life than they can have as servantsof the people there is another element in nietzsche which is closely akin to the objection urged by ruggedindividualists against tradeunions in a fight of all against all the victor is likely to possesscertain qualities which nietzsche admires such as courage resourcefulness and strength of will but if the men who do not possess these aristocratic qualities bandthemselves together they may win in spite of their individual inferiority in this fight of thecollective canaille against the aristocrats christianity is the ideological front as the french revolution was the fighting front we ought therefore to oppose every kind of union among theindividually feeble for fear lest their combined power should outweigh that of the individuallystrong on the other hand we ought to promote union among the tough and virile elements of thepopulation the first step towards the creation of such a union is the preaching of nietzschesphilosophy it will be seen that it is not easy to preserve the distinction between ethics andpolitics suppose we wishas i certainly doto find arguments against nietzsches ethics and politics whatarguments can we find there are weighty practical arguments showing that the attempt to secure his ends will in factsecure something quite different aristocracies of birth are nowadays discredited the onlypracticable form of aristocracy is an organization like the fascist or the nazi party such anorganization rouses opposition and is likely to be defeated in war but if it is not defeated it mustbefore long become nothing but a police state where the rulers live in terror of assassination andthe heroes are in concentration camps in such a community faith and honour are sapped bydelation and the wouldbe aristocracy of supermen degenerates into a clique of tremblingpoltroons these however are arguments for our time they would not have held good in past ages when aristocracy was unquestioned the egyptian government wasconducted on nietzschean principles for several millennia the governments of almost all large states were aristocratic until the american and the french revolutions we have therefore to askourselves whether there is any good reason for preferring democracy to a form of governmentwhich has had such a long and successful historyor rather since we are concerned withphilosophy not politics whether there are objective grounds for rejecting the ethic by which nietzsche supports aristocracy the ethical as opposed to the political question is one as to sympathy sympathy in the sense ofbeing made unhappy by the sufferings of others is to some extent natural to human beings youngchildren are troubled when they hear other children crying but the development of this feeling isvery different in different people some find pleasure in the infliction of torture others like buddha feel that they cannot be completely happy so long as any living thing is suffering mostpeople divide mankind emotionally into friends and enemies feeling sympathy for the former butnot for the latter an ethic such as that of christianity or buddhism has its emotional basis inuniversal sympathy nietzsches in a complete absence of sympathy the question is if buddha and nietzsche were confronted could either produce anyargument that ought to appeal to the impartial listener i am not thinking of political arguments we can imagine them appearing before the almighty as in the first chapter of the book of joband offering advice as to the sort of world he should create what could either say buddha would open the argument by speaking of the lepers outcast and miserable the poortoiling with aching limbs and barely kept alive by scanty nourishment the wounded in battledying in slow agony the orphans illtreated by cruel guardians and even the most successfulhaunted by the thought of failure and death from all this load of sorrow he would say a way ofsalvation must be found and salvation can only come through love nietzsche whom only omnipotence could restrain from interrupting would burst out when histurn came good heavens man you must learn to be of tougher fibre why go about snivellingbecause 
held good in past ages when aristocracy was unquestioned the egyptian government wasconducted on nietzschean principles for several millennia the governments of almost all large states were aristocratic until the american and the french revolutions we have therefore to askourselves whether there is any good reason for preferring democracy to a form of governmentwhich has had such a long and successful historyor rather since we are concerned withphilosophy not politics whether there are objective grounds for rejecting the ethic by which nietzsche supports aristocracy the ethical as opposed to the political question is one as to sympathy sympathy in the sense ofbeing made unhappy by the sufferings of others is to some extent natural to human beings youngchildren are troubled when they hear other children crying but the development of this feeling isvery different in different people some find pleasure in the infliction of torture others like buddha feel that they cannot be completely happy so long as any living thing is suffering mostpeople divide mankind emotionally into friends and enemies feeling sympathy for the former butnot for the latter an ethic such as that of christianity or buddhism has its emotional basis inuniversal sympathy nietzsches in a complete absence of sympathy the question is if buddha and nietzsche were confronted could either produce anyargument that ought to appeal to the impartial listener i am not thinking of political arguments we can imagine them appearing before the almighty as in the first chapter of the book of joband offering advice as to the sort of world he should create what could either say buddha would open the argument by speaking of the lepers outcast and miserable the poortoiling with aching limbs and barely kept alive by scanty nourishment the wounded in battledying in slow agony the orphans illtreated by cruel guardians and even the most successfulhaunted by the thought of failure and death from all this load of sorrow he would say a way ofsalvation must be found and salvation can only come through love nietzsche whom only omnipotence could restrain from interrupting would burst out when histurn came good heavens man you must learn to be of tougher fibre why go about snivellingbecause trivial people suffer or for that matter because great men suffer trivial people suffer triviallygreat men suffer greatly and great sufferings are not to be regretted because they are noble yourideal is a purely negative one absence of suffering which can be completely secured by nonexistence i on the other hand have positive ideals i admire alcibiades and the emperor frederick ii and napoleon for the sake of such men any misery is worth while i appeal to you lord as the greatest of creative artists do not let your artistic impulses be curbed by thedegenerate fearridden maunderings of this wretched psychopath buddha who in the courts of heaven has learnt all history since his death and has masteredscience with delight in the knowledge and sorrow at the use to which men have put it replies withcalm urbanity you are mistaken professor nietzsche in thinking my ideal a purely negativeone true it includes a negative element the absence of suffering but it has in addition quite asmuch that is positive as is to be found in your doctrine though i have no special admiration for alcibiades and napoleon i too have my heroes my successor jesus because he told men to lovetheir enemies the men who discovered how to master the forces of nature and secure food withless labour the medical men who have shown how to diminish disease the poets and artists andmusicians who have caught glimpses of the divine beatitude love and knowledge and delight inbeauty are not negations they are enough to fill the lives of the greatest men that have ever livedall the same nietzsche replies your world would be insipid you should study heraclituswhose works survive complete in the celestial library your love is compassion which is elicitedby pain your truth if you are honest is unpleasant and only to be known through suffering andas to beauty what is more beautiful than the tiger who owes his splendour to his fierceness noif the lord should decide for your world i fear we should all die of boredom you might buddha replies because you love pain and your love of life is a sham but thosewho really love life would be happy as no one can be happy in the world as it is for my part i agree with buddha as i have imagined him but i do not know how to prove that heis right by any argument such as can be used in a mathematical or a scientific question i dislike

of a movement of this sort he was born in but did not become a radical till he waspainfully shy and could not without great trepidation endure the company of strangers he wrotevoluminously but never bothered to publish what was published under his name had beenbenevolently purloined by his friends his main interest was jurisprudence in which herecognized helvtius and beccaria as his most important predecessors it was through thetheory of law that he became interested in ethics and politics he bases his whole philosophy on two principles the association principle and the greatesthappiness principle the association principle had been emphasised by hartley in beforehim though association of ideas was recognized as occurring it was regarded for instance by locke only as a source of trivial errors bentham following hartley made it the basic principleof psychology he recognizes association of ideas and language and also association of ideas andideas by means of this principle he aims at a deterministic account of mental occurrences inessence the doctrine is the same as the more modern theory of the conditioned reflex based on pavlovs experiments the only important difference is that pavlovs conditioned reflex isphysiological whereas the association of ideas was purely mental pavlovs work is thereforecapable of a materialistic explanation such as is given to it by the behaviourists whereas theassociation of ideas led rather towards a psychology more or less independent of physiology there can be no doubt that scientifically the principle of the conditioned reflex is an advance onthe older principle pavlovs principle is this given a reflex according to which a stimulus bproduces a reaction c and given that a certain animal has frequently experienced a stimulus a atthe same time as b it often happens that in time the stimulus a will produce the reaction c evenwhen b is absent to determine the circumstances under which this happens is a matter ofexperiment clearly if we substitute ideas for a b and c pavlovs principle becomes that of theassociation of ideas both principles indubitably are valid over a certain field the only controversial question is as tothe extent of this field bentham and his followers exaggerated the extent of the field in the case of hartleys principle as certain behaviourists have in the case of pavlovs principle to bentham determinism in psychology was important because he wished to establish a code of lawsand more generally a social systemwhich wouldautomatically make men virtuous his second principle that of the greatest happiness becamenecessary at this point in order to define virtue bentham maintained that what is good is pleasure or happinesshe used these words as synonymsand what is bad is pain therefore one state of affairs is better than another if it involves a greaterbalance of pleasure over pain or a smaller balance of pain over pleasure of all possible states ofaffairs that one is best which involves the greatest balance of pleasure over pain there is nothing new in this doctrine which came to be called utilitarianism it had beenadvocated by hutcheson as early as bentham attributes it to priestley who however had nospecial claim to it it is virtually contained in locke benthams merit consisted not in the doctrinebut in his vigorous application of it to various practical problems bentham held not only that the good is happiness in general but also that each individual alwayspursues what he believes to be his own happiness the business of the legislator therefore is toproduce harmony between public and private interests it is to the interest of the public that ishould abstain from theft but it is only to my interest where there is an effective criminal law thus the criminal law is a method of making the interests of the individual coincide with those ofthe community that is its justification men are to be punished by the criminal law in order to prevent crime not because we hate thecriminal it is more important that the punishment should be certain than that it should be severe in his day in england many quite minor offences were subject to the death penalty with theresult that juries often refused to convict because they thought the penalty excessive benthamadvocated abolition of the death penalty for all but the worst offences and before he died thecriminal law had been mitigated in this respect civil law he says should have four aims subsistence abundance security and equality it will beobserved that he does not mention liberty in fact he cared little for liberty he admired thebenevolent autocrats who preceded the french revolutioncatherine the great and the emperor francis he had a great contempt for the doctrine of the rights of man the rights of man he saidare plain nonsense 
he wished to establish a code of lawsand more generally a social systemwhich wouldautomatically make men virtuous his second principle that of the greatest happiness becamenecessary at this point in order to define virtue bentham maintained that what is good is pleasure or happinesshe used these words as synonymsand what is bad is pain therefore one state of affairs is better than another if it involves a greaterbalance of pleasure over pain or a smaller balance of pain over pleasure of all possible states ofaffairs that one is best which involves the greatest balance of pleasure over pain there is nothing new in this doctrine which came to be called utilitarianism it had beenadvocated by hutcheson as early as bentham attributes it to priestley who however had nospecial claim to it it is virtually contained in locke benthams merit consisted not in the doctrinebut in his vigorous application of it to various practical problems bentham held not only that the good is happiness in general but also that each individual alwayspursues what he believes to be his own happiness the business of the legislator therefore is toproduce harmony between public and private interests it is to the interest of the public that ishould abstain from theft but it is only to my interest where there is an effective criminal law thus the criminal law is a method of making the interests of the individual coincide with those ofthe community that is its justification men are to be punished by the criminal law in order to prevent crime not because we hate thecriminal it is more important that the punishment should be certain than that it should be severe in his day in england many quite minor offences were subject to the death penalty with theresult that juries often refused to convict because they thought the penalty excessive benthamadvocated abolition of the death penalty for all but the worst offences and before he died thecriminal law had been mitigated in this respect civil law he says should have four aims subsistence abundance security and equality it will beobserved that he does not mention liberty in fact he cared little for liberty he admired thebenevolent autocrats who preceded the french revolutioncatherine the great and the emperor francis he had a great contempt for the doctrine of the rights of man the rights of man he saidare plain nonsense the imprescriptible rights of man nonsense on stilts when the french revolutionaries made their dclaration des droits de lhomme bentham called it a metaphysical workthe ne plus ultraof metaphysics its articles he said could be divided into three classes those that areunintelligible those that are false those that are both benthams ideal like that of epicurus was security not liberty wars and storms are best to readof but peace and calms are better to endure his gradual evolution towards radicalism had two sources on the one hand a belief in equalitydeduced from the calculus of pleasures and pains on the other hand an inflexible determinationto submit everything to the arbitrament of reason as he understood it his love of equality early ledhim to advocate equal division of a mans property among his children and to opposetestamentary freedom in later years it led him to oppose monarchy and hereditary aristocracy andto advocate complete democracy including votes for women his refusal to believe withoutrational grounds led him to reject religion including belief in god it made him keenly critical ofabsurdities and anomalies in the law however venerable their historical origin he would notexcuse anything on the ground that it was traditional from early youth he was opposed toimperialism whether that of the british in america or that of other nations he consideredcolonies a folly it was through the influence of james mill that bentham was induced to take sides in practicalpolitics james mill was twentyfive years younger than bentham and an ardent disciple of hisdoctrines but he was also an active radical bentham gave mill a house and assisted him financially while he wrote a history of india when this history wasfinished the east india company gave james mill a post as they did afterwards to his son untiltheir abolition as a sequel to the mutiny james mill greatly admired condorcet and helvtius like all radicals of that period he believed in the omnipotence of education he practised histheories on his son john stuart mill with results partly good partly bad the most important badresult was that john stuart could never quite shake off his influence even when he perceived thathis fathers outlook had been narrow james mill like bentham considered pleasure the only good and

balls this was certainly the view of epicurus who in most respects based his theories on thoseof democritus while trying rather unintelligently to take account of aristotles criticisms butthere is considerable reason to think that weight was not an original property of the atoms of leucippus and democritus it seems more probable that on their view atoms were originallymoving at random as in the modern kinetic theory of gases democritus said there was neitherup nor down in the infinite void and compared the movement of atoms in the soul to that ofmotes in a sunbeam when there is no wind this is a much more intelligent view than that of epicurus and i think we may assume it to have been that of leucippus and democritus as a result of collisions collections of atoms came to form vortices the rest proceeded muchas in anaxagoras but it was an advance to explain the vortices mechanically rather than as dueto the action of mind it was common in antiquity to reproach the atomists with attributing everything to chance theywere on the contrary strict determinists who believed that everything happens in accordancewith natural laws democritus explicitly denied that anything can happen by chance leucippus though his existence is questioned is known to have said one thing naughthappens for nothing but everything from a ground and of necessity it is true that he gave noreason why the world should originally have been as it was this perhaps might have beenattributed to chance but when once the world existed its further development was unalterablyfixed by mechanical principles aristotle and others reproached him and democritus for notaccounting for the original motion of the atoms but in this the atomists were more scientificthan their critics causation must start from something and wherever it starts no cause can beassigned for the initial datum the world may be attributed to a creator but even then the creator himself is unaccounted for the theory of the atomists in fact was more nearly that ofmodern science than any other theory propounded in antiquity the atomists unlike socrates plato and aristotle sought to ex  this interpretation is adopted by burnet and also at least as regards leucippus by bailey see bailey op cit p on the determinism of democritus plain the world without introducing the notion of purpose or final cause the final cause of anoccurrence is an event in the future for the sake of which the occurrence takes place in humanaffairs this conception is applicable why does the baker make bread because people will behungry why are railways built because people will wish to travel in such cases things areexplained by the purpose they serve when we ask why concerning an event we may meaneither of two things we may mean what purpose did this event serve or we may mean whatearlier circumstances caused this event the answer to the former question is a teleologicalexplanation or an explanation by final causes the answer to the latter question is a mechanisticexplanation i do not see how it could have been known in advance which of these two questionsscience ought to ask or whether it ought to ask both but experience has shown that themechanistic question leads to scientific knowledge while the teleological question does not theatomists asked the mechanistic question and gave a mechanistic answer their successors untilthe renaissance were more interested in the teleological question and thus led science up a blindalley in regard to both questions alike there is a limitation which is often ignored both in popularthought and in philosophy neither question can be asked intelligibly about reality as a whole but only about parts of it as regards the teleological explanation it usuallyarrives before long at a creator or at least an artificer whose purposes are realized in the courseof nature but if a man is so obstinately teleological as to continue to ask what purpose is servedby the creator it becomes obvious that his question is impious it is moreover unmeaning sinceto make it significant we should have to suppose the creator created by some super creatorwhose purposes he served the conception of purpose therefore is only applicable within realitynot to reality as a whole a not dissimilar argument applies to mechanistic explanations one event is caused by anotherthe other by a third and so on but if we ask for a cause of the whole we are driven again to the creator who must himself be uncaused all causal explanations therefore must have an arbitrarybeginning that is why it is no defect in the theory of the atomists to have left the originalmovements of the atoms unaccounted for

pleasure from achieving my wish in this sense whatever i desire is a pleasure and it may be saidthough somewhat loosely that pleasures are what i desire this is the sense of the doctrine whichis a truism but if what is meant is that when i desire anything i desire it because of the pleasure that it willgive me that is usually untrue when i am hungry i desire food and so long as my hunger persistsfood will give me pleasure but the hunger which is a desire comes first the pleasure is aconsequence of the desire i do not deny that there are occasions when there is a direct desire forpleasure if you have decided to devote a free evening to the theatre you will choose the theatrethat you think will give you the most pleasure but the actions thus determined by the direct desirefor pleasure are exceptional and unimportant everybodys main activities are determined bydesires which are anterior to the calculation of pleasures and pains anything whatever may be an object of desire a masochist may desire his own pain themasochist no doubt derives pleasure from the pain that he has desired but the pleasure is becauseof the desire not vice versa a man may desire something that does not affect him personallyexcept because of his desirefor instance the victory of one side in a war in which his country isneutral he may desire an increase of general happiness or a mitigation of general suffering or hemay like carlyle desire the exact opposite as his desires vary so do his pleasures ethics is necessary because mens desires conflict the primary cause of conflict is egoism mostpeople are more interested in their own welfare than in that of other people but conflicts areequally possible where there is no element of egoism one man may wish everybody to be catholic another may wish everybody to be calvinist such nonegoistic desires are frequentlyinvolved in social conflicts ethics has a twofold purpose first to find a criterion by which todistinguish good and bad desires second by means of praise and blame to promote good desiresand discourage such as are bad the ethical part of the utilitarian doctrine which is logically independent of the psychologicalpart says those desires and those actions are good which in fact promote the general happiness this need not be the intention of an action but only its effect is there any valid theoreticalargument either for or against this doctrine we found ourselves faced with a similar question inrelation to nietzsche his ethic differs from that of the utilitarians since it holds that only a minority of the human racehave ethical importancethe happiness or unhappiness of the remainder should be ignored i donot myself believe that this disagreement can be dealt with by theoretical arguments such as mightbe used in a scientific question obviously those who are excluded from the nietzscheanaristocracy will object and thus the issue becomes political rather than theoretical the utilitarianethic is democratic and antiromantic democrats are likely to accept it but those who like a more byronic view of the world can in my opinion be refuted only practically not by considerationswhich appeal only to facts as opposed to desires the philosophical radicals were a transitional school their system gave birth to two others ofmore importance than itself namely darwinism and socialism darwinism was an application tothe whole of animal and vegetable life of malthuss theory of population which was an integralpart of the politics and economics of the benthamites a global free competition in which victorywent to the animals that most resembled successful capitalists darwin himself was influenced by malthus and was in general sympathy with the philosophical radicals there was however agreat difference between the competition admired by orthodox economists and the struggle forexistence which darwin proclaimed as the motive force of evolution free competition inorthodox economics is a very artificial conception hedged in by legal restrictions you mayundersell a competitor but you must not murder him you must not use the armed forces of the state to help you to get the better of foreign manufacturers those who have not the good fortuneto possess capital must not seek to improve their lot by revolution free competition asunderstood by the benthamites was by no means really free darwinian competition was not of this limited sort there were no rules against hitting below thebelt the framework of law does not exist among animals nor is war excluded as a competitivemethod the use of the state to secure victory in competition was against the rules as conceivedby the benthamites but could not be excluded from the darwinian struggle in fact though darwin himself was a liberal and though nietzsche never mentions him except with contempt darwin survival of the fittest led when thoroughly 
his ethic differs from that of the utilitarians since it holds that only a minority of the human racehave ethical importancethe happiness or unhappiness of the remainder should be ignored i donot myself believe that this disagreement can be dealt with by theoretical arguments such as mightbe used in a scientific question obviously those who are excluded from the nietzscheanaristocracy will object and thus the issue becomes political rather than theoretical the utilitarianethic is democratic and antiromantic democrats are likely to accept it but those who like a more byronic view of the world can in my opinion be refuted only practically not by considerationswhich appeal only to facts as opposed to desires the philosophical radicals were a transitional school their system gave birth to two others ofmore importance than itself namely darwinism and socialism darwinism was an application tothe whole of animal and vegetable life of malthuss theory of population which was an integralpart of the politics and economics of the benthamites a global free competition in which victorywent to the animals that most resembled successful capitalists darwin himself was influenced by malthus and was in general sympathy with the philosophical radicals there was however agreat difference between the competition admired by orthodox economists and the struggle forexistence which darwin proclaimed as the motive force of evolution free competition inorthodox economics is a very artificial conception hedged in by legal restrictions you mayundersell a competitor but you must not murder him you must not use the armed forces of the state to help you to get the better of foreign manufacturers those who have not the good fortuneto possess capital must not seek to improve their lot by revolution free competition asunderstood by the benthamites was by no means really free darwinian competition was not of this limited sort there were no rules against hitting below thebelt the framework of law does not exist among animals nor is war excluded as a competitivemethod the use of the state to secure victory in competition was against the rules as conceivedby the benthamites but could not be excluded from the darwinian struggle in fact though darwin himself was a liberal and though nietzsche never mentions him except with contempt darwin survival of the fittest led when thoroughly assimilated to something much more like nietzsches philosophy than like benthams thesedevelopments however belong to a later period since darwin origin of species was published in and its political implications were not at first perceived socialism on the contrary began in the heyday of benthamism and as a direct outcome oforthodox economics ricardo who was intimately associated with bentham malthus and james mill taught that the exchange value of a commodity is entirely due to the labour expended inproducing it he published this theory in and eight years later thomas hodgskin an exnaval officer published the first socialist rejoinder labour defended against the claims of capital he argued that if as ricardo taught all value is conferred by labour then all the rewardought to go to labour the share at present obtained by the landowner and the capitalist must bemere extortion meanwhile robert owen after much practical experience as a manufacturer hadbecome convinced of the doctrine which soon came to be called socialism machinery he saidwas displacing labour and laisser faire gave the working classes no adequate means of combatingmechanical power the method which he proposed for dealing with the evil was the earliest formof modern socialism although owen was a friend of bentham who had invested a considerable sum of money in owens business the philosophical radicals did not like his new doctrines in fact the advent of socialism made them less radical and less philosophical than they had been hodgskin secured acertain following in london and james mill was horrified he wrote their notions of property look ugly  they seem to think that it should not exist and that theexistence of it is an evil to them rascals i have no doubt are at work among them  the foolsnot to see that what they madly desire would be such a calamity to them as no hands but their owncould bring upon them this letter written in may be taken as the beginning of the long war between capitalismand socialism in a later letter james mill attributes the doctrine to the mad nonsense of hodgskin and adds these opinions if they were to spread would be the subversion 
assimilated to something much more like nietzsches philosophy than like benthams thesedevelopments however belong to a later period since darwin origin of species was published in and its political implications were not at first perceived socialism on the contrary began in the heyday of benthamism and as a direct outcome oforthodox economics ricardo who was intimately associated with bentham malthus and james mill taught that the exchange value of a commodity is entirely due to the labour expended inproducing it he published this theory in and eight years later thomas hodgskin an exnaval officer published the first socialist rejoinder labour defended against the claims of capital he argued that if as ricardo taught all value is conferred by labour then all the rewardought to go to labour the share at present obtained by the landowner and the capitalist must bemere extortion meanwhile robert owen after much practical experience as a manufacturer hadbecome convinced of the doctrine which soon came to be called socialism machinery he saidwas displacing labour and laisser faire gave the working classes no adequate means of combatingmechanical power the method which he proposed for dealing with the evil was the earliest formof modern socialism although owen was a friend of bentham who had invested a considerable sum of money in owens business the philosophical radicals did not like his new doctrines in fact the advent of socialism made them less radical and less philosophical than they had been hodgskin secured acertain following in london and james mill was horrified he wrote their notions of property look ugly  they seem to think that it should not exist and that theexistence of it is an evil to them rascals i have no doubt are at work among them  the foolsnot to see that what they madly desire would be such a calamity to them as no hands but their owncould bring upon them this letter written in may be taken as the beginning of the long war between capitalismand socialism in a later letter james mill attributes the doctrine to the mad nonsense of hodgskin and adds these opinions if they were to spread would be the subversion of civilized society worse than the overwhelming deluge of huns and tartars socialism in so far as it is only political or economic does not come within the purview of ahistory of philosophy but in the hands of karl marx socialism acquired a philosophy hisphilosophy will be considered in the next chapter chapter xxvii karl marx marx is usually thought of as the man who claimed to have made socialism scientific and whodid more than any one else to create the powerful movement which by attraction and repulsionhas dominated the recent history of europe it does not come within the scope of the present workto consider his economics or his politics except in certain general aspects it is only as aphilosopher and an influence on the philosophy of others that i propose to deal with him in thisrespect he is difficult to classify in one aspect he is an outcome like hodgskin of the philosophical radicals continuing their rationalism and their opposition to the romantics inanother aspect he is a revivifier of materialism giving it a new interpretation and a newconnection with human history in yet another aspect he is the last of the great systembuilders thesuccessor of hegel a believer like him in a rational formula summing up the evolution ofmankind emphasis upon any one of these aspects at the expense of the others gives a false anddistorted view of his philosophy the events of his life in part account for this complexity he was born in at trves like saint ambrose trves had been profoundly influenced by the french during the revolutionaryand napoleonic era and was much more cosmopolitan in outlook than most parts of germany his ancestors had been rabbis but his parents became christian when he was a child he marrieda gentile aristocrat 
of civilized society worse than the overwhelming deluge of huns and tartars socialism in so far as it is only political or economic does not come within the purview of ahistory of philosophy but in the hands of karl marx socialism acquired a philosophy hisphilosophy will be considered in the next chapter chapter xxvii karl marx marx is usually thought of as the man who claimed to have made socialism scientific and whodid more than any one else to create the powerful movement which by attraction and repulsionhas dominated the recent history of europe it does not come within the scope of the present workto consider his economics or his politics except in certain general aspects it is only as aphilosopher and an influence on the philosophy of others that i propose to deal with him in thisrespect he is difficult to classify in one aspect he is an outcome like hodgskin of the philosophical radicals continuing their rationalism and their opposition to the romantics inanother aspect he is a revivifier of materialism giving it a new interpretation and a newconnection with human history in yet another aspect he is the last of the great systembuilders thesuccessor of hegel a believer like him in a rational formula summing up the evolution ofmankind emphasis upon any one of these aspects at the expense of the others gives a false anddistorted view of his philosophy the events of his life in part account for this complexity he was born in at trves like saint ambrose trves had been profoundly influenced by the french during the revolutionaryand napoleonic era and was much more cosmopolitan in outlook than most parts of germany his ancestors had been rabbis but his parents became christian when he was a child he marrieda gentile aristocrat to whom he remained devoted throughout his life at the university he was influenced by the stillprevalent hegelianism as also by feuerbachs revolt against hegel towards materialism he triedjournalism but the rheinische zeitung which he edited was suppressed by the authorities for itsradicalism after this in he went to france to study socialism there he met engels whowas the manager of a factory in manchester through him he came to know english labourconditions and english economics he thus acquired before the revolutions of an unusuallyinternational culture so far as western europe was concerned he showed no national bias thiscannot be said of eastern europe for he always despised the slavs he took part in both the french and the german revolutions of but the reaction compelledhim to seek refuge in england in he spent the rest of his life with a few brief intervals in london troubled by poverty illness and the deaths of children but nevertheless indefatigablywriting and amassing knowledge the stimulus to his work was always the hope of the socialrevolution if not in his lifetime then in some not very distant future marx like bentham and james mill will have nothing to do with romanticism it is always hisintention to be scientific his economics is an outcome of british classical economics changingonly the motive force classical economists consciously or unconsciously aimed at the welfare ofthe capitalist as opposed both to the landowner and to the wageearner marx on the contrary setto work to represent the interest of the wageearner he had in youthas appears in the communist manifesto of the fire and passion appropriate to a new revolutionarymovement as liberalism had had in the time of milton but he was always anxious to appeal toevidence and never relied upon any extrascientific intuition he called himself a materialist but not of the eighteenthcentury sort his sort which under hegelian influence he called dialectical differed in an important way from traditionalmaterialism and was more akin to what is now called instrumentalism the older materialism hesaid mistakenly regarded sensation as passive and thus attributed activity primarily to the object in marxs view all sensation or perception is an interaction between subject and object the bareobject apart from the activity of the percipient is a mere raw material which is transformed in theprocess of becoming known 
to whom he remained devoted throughout his life at the university he was influenced by the stillprevalent hegelianism as also by feuerbachs revolt against hegel towards materialism he triedjournalism but the rheinische zeitung which he edited was suppressed by the authorities for itsradicalism after this in he went to france to study socialism there he met engels whowas the manager of a factory in manchester through him he came to know english labourconditions and english economics he thus acquired before the revolutions of an unusuallyinternational culture so far as western europe was concerned he showed no national bias thiscannot be said of eastern europe for he always despised the slavs he took part in both the french and the german revolutions of but the reaction compelledhim to seek refuge in england in he spent the rest of his life with a few brief intervals in london troubled by poverty illness and the deaths of children but nevertheless indefatigablywriting and amassing knowledge the stimulus to his work was always the hope of the socialrevolution if not in his lifetime then in some not very distant future marx like bentham and james mill will have nothing to do with romanticism it is always hisintention to be scientific his economics is an outcome of british classical economics changingonly the motive force classical economists consciously or unconsciously aimed at the welfare ofthe capitalist as opposed both to the landowner and to the wageearner marx on the contrary setto work to represent the interest of the wageearner he had in youthas appears in the communist manifesto of the fire and passion appropriate to a new revolutionarymovement as liberalism had had in the time of milton but he was always anxious to appeal toevidence and never relied upon any extrascientific intuition he called himself a materialist but not of the eighteenthcentury sort his sort which under hegelian influence he called dialectical differed in an important way from traditionalmaterialism and was more akin to what is now called instrumentalism the older materialism hesaid mistakenly regarded sensation as passive and thus attributed activity primarily to the object in marxs view all sensation or perception is an interaction between subject and object the bareobject apart from the activity of the percipient is a mere raw material which is transformed in theprocess of becoming known knowledge in the old sense of passive contemplation is an unreal abstraction the process thatreally takes place is one of handling things the question whether objective truth belongs tohuman thinking is not a question of theory but a practical question he says the truth iethe reality and power of thought must be demonstrated in practice the contest as to the realityor nonreality of a thought which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question  philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways but the real task is to alter it i think we may interpret marx as meaning that the process which philosophers have called thepursuit of knowledge is not as has been thought one in which the object is constant while allthe adaptation is on the part of the knower on the contrary both subject and object both theknower and the thing known are in a continual process of mutual adaptation he calls theprocess dialectical because it is never fully completed it is essential to this theory to deny the reality of sensation as conceived by british empiricists what happens when it is most nearly what they mean by sensation would be better callednoticing which implies activity in factso marx would contendwe only notice things aspart of the process of acting with reference to them and any theory which leaves out action is amisleading abstraction so far as i know marx was the first philosopher who criticized the notion of truth from thisactivist point of view in him this criticism was not much emphasized and i shall therefore sayno more about it here leaving the examination of the theory to a later chapter marxs philosophy of history is a blend of hegel and british economics like hegel he thinksthat the world develops according to a dialectical formula but he totally disagrees with hegel asto the motive force of this development hegel believed in a mystical entity called spiritwhich causes human history to develop according to the stages of the dialectic as set forth in hegels logic why spirit has to go through these stages is not clear one is tempted to supposethat spirit is trying to understand hegel and at each stage rashly objectifies what it has beenreading marxs dialectic has none of this quality except a certain inevitableness for marxmatter not spirit  eleven theses on feuerbach

professed himself an atheist but retained a cosmic optimism which only theism could justify broadly speaking all the elements in marxs philosophy which are derived from hegel areunscientific in the sense that there is no reason whatever to suppose them true perhaps the philosophic dress that marx gave to his socialism had really not much to do withthe basis of his opinions it is easy to restate the most important part of what he had to saywithout any reference to the dialectic he was impressed by the appalling cruelty of theindustrial system as it existed in england a hundred years ago which he came to knowthoroughly through engels and the reports of royal commissions he saw that the system waslikely to develop from free competition towards monopoly and that its injustice must produce amovement of revolt in the proletariat he held that in a thoroughly industrialized communitythe only alternative to private capitalism is state ownership of land and capital none of thesepropositions are matters for philosophy and i shall therefore not consider their truth orfalsehood the point is that if true they suffice to establish what is practically important in hissystem the hegelian trappings might therefore be dropped with advantage the history of marxs reputation has been peculiar in his own country his doctrines inspired theprogramme of the social democratic party which grew steadily until in the general election of it secured one third of all the votes cast immediately after the first world war the social democratic party was for a time in power and ebert the first president of the weimar republic was a member of it but by this time the party had ceased to adhere to marxistorthodoxy meanwhile in russia fanatical believers in marx had acquired the government inthe west no large workingclass movement has been marxist the british labour party attimes has seemed to move in that direction but has nevertheless adhered to an empirical typeof socialism large numbers of intellectuals however have been profoundly influenced byhim both in england and in america in germany all advocacy of his doctrines has beenforcibly suppressed but may be expected to revive when the nazis are overthrown modern europe and america have thus been divided politically  i am writing in  and ideologically into three camps there are liberals who still as far as may be follow lockeor bentham but with varying degrees of adaptation to the needs of industrial organization thereare marxists who control the government in russia and are likely to become increasinglyinfluential in various other countries these two sections of opinion are philosophically not verywidely separated both are rationalistic and both in intention are scientific and empirical butfrom the point of view of practical politics the division is sharp it appears already in the letter of james mill quoted in the preceding chapter saying their notions of property look ugly it must however be admitted that there are certain respects in which the rationalism of marx issubject to limitations although he holds that his interpretation of the trend of development is trueand will be borne out by events he believes that the argument will only appeal to those whose class interest is in agreement with it he hopes little from persuasioneverything from the class war he is thus committed in practice to power politics and to thedoctrine of a master class though not of a master race it is true that as a result of the socialrevolution the division of classes is expected ultimately to disappear giving place to completepolitical and economic harmony but this is a distant ideal like the second coming in themeantime there is war and dictatorship and insistence upon ideological orthodoxy the third section of modern opinion represented politically by nazis and fascists differsphilosophically from the other two far more profoundly than they differ from each other it is antirational and antiscientific its philosophical progenitors are rousseau fichte and nietzsche itemphasizes will especially will to power this it believes to be mainly concentrated in certainraces and individuals who therefore have a right to rule until rousseau the philosophical world had a certain unity this has disappeared for the timebeing but perhaps not for long it can be recovered by a rationalistic reconquest of mens mindsbut not in any other way since claims to mastery can only breed strife 
and ideologically into three camps there are liberals who still as far as may be follow lockeor bentham but with varying degrees of adaptation to the needs of industrial organization thereare marxists who control the government in russia and are likely to become increasinglyinfluential in various other countries these two sections of opinion are philosophically not verywidely separated both are rationalistic and both in intention are scientific and empirical butfrom the point of view of practical politics the division is sharp it appears already in the letter of james mill quoted in the preceding chapter saying their notions of property look ugly it must however be admitted that there are certain respects in which the rationalism of marx issubject to limitations although he holds that his interpretation of the trend of development is trueand will be borne out by events he believes that the argument will only appeal to those whose class interest is in agreement with it he hopes little from persuasioneverything from the class war he is thus committed in practice to power politics and to thedoctrine of a master class though not of a master race it is true that as a result of the socialrevolution the division of classes is expected ultimately to disappear giving place to completepolitical and economic harmony but this is a distant ideal like the second coming in themeantime there is war and dictatorship and insistence upon ideological orthodoxy the third section of modern opinion represented politically by nazis and fascists differsphilosophically from the other two far more profoundly than they differ from each other it is antirational and antiscientific its philosophical progenitors are rousseau fichte and nietzsche itemphasizes will especially will to power this it believes to be mainly concentrated in certainraces and individuals who therefore have a right to rule until rousseau the philosophical world had a certain unity this has disappeared for the timebeing but perhaps not for long it can be recovered by a rationalistic reconquest of mens mindsbut not in any other way since claims to mastery can only breed strife chapter xxviii bergson i henri bergson was the leading french philosopher of the present century he influenced william james and whitehead and had a considerable effect upon french thought sorel whowas a vehement advocate of syndicalism and the author of a book called reflections on violence used bergsonian irrationalism to justify a revolutionary labour movement having nodefinite goal in the end however sorel abandoned syndicalism and became a royalist themain effect of bergsons philosophy was conservative and it harmonized easily with themovement which culminated in vichy but bergsons irrationalism made a wide appeal quiteunconnected with politics for instance to bernard shaw whose back to methuselah is pure bergsonism forgetting politics it is in its purely philosophical aspect that we must consider it i have dealt with it somewhat fully as it exemplifies admirably the revolt against reason whichbeginning with rousseau has gradually dominated larger and larger areas in the life andthought of the world the classification of philosophies is effected as a rule either by their methods or by theirresults empirical and a priori is a classification by methods realist and idealist is aclassification by results an attempt to classify bergsons philosophy in either of these ways ishardly likely to be successful since it cuts across all the recognized divisions but there is another way of classifying philosophies less precise but perhaps more helpful tothe nonphilosophical in this way the principle of division is according to the predominantdesire which  the remainder of this chapter is in the main a reprint of an article published in the monistfor  
chapter xxviii bergson i henri bergson was the leading french philosopher of the present century he influenced william james and whitehead and had a considerable effect upon french thought sorel whowas a vehement advocate of syndicalism and the author of a book called reflections on violence used bergsonian irrationalism to justify a revolutionary labour movement having nodefinite goal in the end however sorel abandoned syndicalism and became a royalist themain effect of bergsons philosophy was conservative and it harmonized easily with themovement which culminated in vichy but bergsons irrationalism made a wide appeal quiteunconnected with politics for instance to bernard shaw whose back to methuselah is pure bergsonism forgetting politics it is in its purely philosophical aspect that we must consider it i have dealt with it somewhat fully as it exemplifies admirably the revolt against reason whichbeginning with rousseau has gradually dominated larger and larger areas in the life andthought of the world the classification of philosophies is effected as a rule either by their methods or by theirresults empirical and a priori is a classification by methods realist and idealist is aclassification by results an attempt to classify bergsons philosophy in either of these ways ishardly likely to be successful since it cuts across all the recognized divisions but there is another way of classifying philosophies less precise but perhaps more helpful tothe nonphilosophical in this way the principle of division is according to the predominantdesire which  the remainder of this chapter is in the main a reprint of an article published in the monistfor  has led the philosopher to philosophize thus we shall have philosophies of feeling inspired bythe love of happiness theoretical philosophies inspired by the love of knowledge and practicalphilosophies inspired by the love of action among philosophies of feeling we shall place all those which are primarily optimistic orpessimistic all those that offer schemes of salvation or try to prove that salvation is impossible tothis class belong most religious philosophies among theoretical philosophies we shall place mostof the great systems for though the desire for knowledge is rare it has been the source of most ofwhat is best in philosophy practical philosophies on the other hand will be those which regardaction as the supreme good considering happiness an effect and knowledge a mere instrument ofsuccessful activity philosophies of this type would have been common among western europeans if philosophers had been average men as it is they have been rare until recent times infact their chief representatives are the pragmatists and bergson in the rise of this type ofphilosophy we may see as bergson himself does the revolt of the modern man of action againstthe authority of greece and more particularly of plato or we may connect it as dr schillerapparently would with imperialism and the motorcar the modern world calls for such aphilosophy and the success which it has achieved is therefore not surprising bergsons philosophy unlike most of the systems of the past is dualistic the world for him isdivided into two disparate portions on the one hand life on the other matter or rather that inertsomething which the intellect views as matter the whole universe is the clash and conflict of twoopposite motions life which climbs upward and matter which falls downward life is one greatforce one vast vital impulse given once for all from the beginning of the world meeting theresistance of matter struggling to break a way through matter learning gradually to use matter bymeans of organization divided by the obstacles it encounters into diverging currents like thewind at the streetcorner partly subdued by matter through the very adaptations which matterforces upon it yet retaining always its capacity for free activity struggling always to find newoutlets seeking always for greater liberty of movement amid the opposing walls of matter evolution is not primarily explicable by adaptation to environment 
has led the philosopher to philosophize thus we shall have philosophies of feeling inspired bythe love of happiness theoretical philosophies inspired by the love of knowledge and practicalphilosophies inspired by the love of action among philosophies of feeling we shall place all those which are primarily optimistic orpessimistic all those that offer schemes of salvation or try to prove that salvation is impossible tothis class belong most religious philosophies among theoretical philosophies we shall place mostof the great systems for though the desire for knowledge is rare it has been the source of most ofwhat is best in philosophy practical philosophies on the other hand will be those which regardaction as the supreme good considering happiness an effect and knowledge a mere instrument ofsuccessful activity philosophies of this type would have been common among western europeans if philosophers had been average men as it is they have been rare until recent times infact their chief representatives are the pragmatists and bergson in the rise of this type ofphilosophy we may see as bergson himself does the revolt of the modern man of action againstthe authority of greece and more particularly of plato or we may connect it as dr schillerapparently would with imperialism and the motorcar the modern world calls for such aphilosophy and the success which it has achieved is therefore not surprising bergsons philosophy unlike most of the systems of the past is dualistic the world for him isdivided into two disparate portions on the one hand life on the other matter or rather that inertsomething which the intellect views as matter the whole universe is the clash and conflict of twoopposite motions life which climbs upward and matter which falls downward life is one greatforce one vast vital impulse given once for all from the beginning of the world meeting theresistance of matter struggling to break a way through matter learning gradually to use matter bymeans of organization divided by the obstacles it encounters into diverging currents like thewind at the streetcorner partly subdued by matter through the very adaptations which matterforces upon it yet retaining always its capacity for free activity struggling always to find newoutlets seeking always for greater liberty of movement amid the opposing walls of matter evolution is not primarily explicable by adaptation to environment adaptation explains only the turns and twists of evolution like the windings of a road approachinga town through hilly country but this simile is not quite adequate there is no town no definitegoal at the end of the road along which evolution travels mechanism and teleology suffer fromthe same defect both suppose that there is no essential novelty in the world mechanism regardsthe future as implicit in the past since it believes that the end to be achieved can be known inadvance denies that any essential novelty is contained in the result as against both these views though with more sympathy for teleology than for mechanism bergson maintains that evolution is truly creative like the work of an artist an impulse to actionan undefined want exists beforehand but until the want is satisfied it is impossible to know thenature of what will satisfy it for example we may suppose some vague desire in sightlessanimals to be able to be aware of objects before they were in contact with them this led to effortswhich finally resulted in the creation of eyes sight satisfied the desire but could not have beenimagined beforehand for this reason evolution is unpredictable and determinism cannot refutethe advocates of free will this broad outline is filled in by an account of the actual development of life on the earth thefirst division of the current was into plants and animals plants aimed at storing up energy in areservoir animals aimed at using energy for sudden and rapid movements but among animals ata later stage a new bifurcation appeared instinct and intellect became more or less separated they are never wholly without each other but in the main intellect is the misfortune of man whileinstinct is seen at its best in ants bees and bergson the division between intellect and instinct isfundamental in his philosophy much of which is a kind of sandford and merton with instinct asthe good boy and intellect as the bad boy instinct at its best is called intuition by intuition he says i mean instinct that has becomedisinterested selfconscious capable of reflecting upon its object and of enlarging it indefinitelythe account of the doings of intellect is not always easy to follow but if we are to understand bergson we must do our best intelligence or intellect as it leaves the hands of nature has for its chief object the inorganicsolid it can only form a clear idea of 
adaptation explains only the turns and twists of evolution like the windings of a road approachinga town through hilly country but this simile is not quite adequate there is no town no definitegoal at the end of the road along which evolution travels mechanism and teleology suffer fromthe same defect both suppose that there is no essential novelty in the world mechanism regardsthe future as implicit in the past since it believes that the end to be achieved can be known inadvance denies that any essential novelty is contained in the result as against both these views though with more sympathy for teleology than for mechanism bergson maintains that evolution is truly creative like the work of an artist an impulse to actionan undefined want exists beforehand but until the want is satisfied it is impossible to know thenature of what will satisfy it for example we may suppose some vague desire in sightlessanimals to be able to be aware of objects before they were in contact with them this led to effortswhich finally resulted in the creation of eyes sight satisfied the desire but could not have beenimagined beforehand for this reason evolution is unpredictable and determinism cannot refutethe advocates of free will this broad outline is filled in by an account of the actual development of life on the earth thefirst division of the current was into plants and animals plants aimed at storing up energy in areservoir animals aimed at using energy for sudden and rapid movements but among animals ata later stage a new bifurcation appeared instinct and intellect became more or less separated they are never wholly without each other but in the main intellect is the misfortune of man whileinstinct is seen at its best in ants bees and bergson the division between intellect and instinct isfundamental in his philosophy much of which is a kind of sandford and merton with instinct asthe good boy and intellect as the bad boy instinct at its best is called intuition by intuition he says i mean instinct that has becomedisinterested selfconscious capable of reflecting upon its object and of enlarging it indefinitelythe account of the doings of intellect is not always easy to follow but if we are to understand bergson we must do our best intelligence or intellect as it leaves the hands of nature has for its chief object the inorganicsolid it can only form a clear idea of the discontinuous and immobile its concepts are outside each other like objects in space and havethe same stability the intellect separates in space and fixes in time it is not made to thinkevolution but to represent becoming as a series of states the intellect is characterized by anatural inability to understand life geometry and logic which are its typical products are strictlyapplicable to solid bodies but elsewhere reasoning must be checked by common sense which as bergson truly says is a very different thing solid bodies it would seem are something whichmind has created on purpose to apply intellect to them much as it has created chessboards inorder to play chess on them the genesis of intellect and the genesis of material bodies we aretold are correlative both have been developed by reciprocal adaptation an identical processmust have cut out matter and the intellect at the same time from a stuff that contained both this conception of the simultaneous growth of matter and intellect is ingenious and deserves tobe understood broadly i think what is meant is this intellect is the power of seeing things asseparate one from another and matter is that which is separated into distinct things in realitythere are no separate solid things only an endless stream of becoming in which nothing becomesand there is nothing that this nothing becomes but becoming may be a movement up or amovement down when it is a movement up it is called life when it is a movement down it iswhat as misapprehended by the intellect is called matter i suppose the universe is shaped like acone with the absolute at the vertex for the movement up brings things together while themovement down separates them or at least seems to do so in order that the upward motion ofmind may be able to thread its way through the downward motion of the falling bodies which hailupon it it must be able to cut out paths between them thus as intelligence was formed outlinesand paths appeared and the primitive flux was cut up into separate bodies the intellect may becompared to a carver but it has the peculiarity of imagining that the chicken always was theseparate pieces into which the carvingknife divides it the intellect bergson says always behaves as if it were fascinated by the contemplation ofinert matter it is life looking outward putting itself outside itself adopting the ways ofunorganized nature in principle in order to direct them in fact if we may be allowed to addanother image to the many by which bergsons philosophy is 
the discontinuous and immobile its concepts are outside each other like objects in space and havethe same stability the intellect separates in space and fixes in time it is not made to thinkevolution but to represent becoming as a series of states the intellect is characterized by anatural inability to understand life geometry and logic which are its typical products are strictlyapplicable to solid bodies but elsewhere reasoning must be checked by common sense which as bergson truly says is a very different thing solid bodies it would seem are something whichmind has created on purpose to apply intellect to them much as it has created chessboards inorder to play chess on them the genesis of intellect and the genesis of material bodies we aretold are correlative both have been developed by reciprocal adaptation an identical processmust have cut out matter and the intellect at the same time from a stuff that contained both this conception of the simultaneous growth of matter and intellect is ingenious and deserves tobe understood broadly i think what is meant is this intellect is the power of seeing things asseparate one from another and matter is that which is separated into distinct things in realitythere are no separate solid things only an endless stream of becoming in which nothing becomesand there is nothing that this nothing becomes but becoming may be a movement up or amovement down when it is a movement up it is called life when it is a movement down it iswhat as misapprehended by the intellect is called matter i suppose the universe is shaped like acone with the absolute at the vertex for the movement up brings things together while themovement down separates them or at least seems to do so in order that the upward motion ofmind may be able to thread its way through the downward motion of the falling bodies which hailupon it it must be able to cut out paths between them thus as intelligence was formed outlinesand paths appeared and the primitive flux was cut up into separate bodies the intellect may becompared to a carver but it has the peculiarity of imagining that the chicken always was theseparate pieces into which the carvingknife divides it the intellect bergson says always behaves as if it were fascinated by the contemplation ofinert matter it is life looking outward putting itself outside itself adopting the ways ofunorganized nature in principle in order to direct them in fact if we may be allowed to addanother image to the many by which bergsons philosophy is illustrated we may say that the universe is a vast funicular railway in which life is the train thatgoes up and matter is the train that goes down the intellect consists in watching the descendingtrain as it passes the ascending train in which we are the obviously nobler faculty whichconcentrates its attention on our own train is instinct or intuition it is possible to leap from onetrain to the other this happens when we become the victims of automatic habit and is the essenceof the comic or we can divide ourselves into parts one part going up and one down then onlythe part going down is comic but intellect is not itself a descending motion it is merely anobservation of the descending motion by the ascending motion intellect which separates things is according to bergson a kind of dream it is not active as allour life ought to be but purely contemplative when we dream he says our self is scattered ourpast is broken into fragments things which really interpenetrate each other are seen as separatesolid units the extraspatial degrades itself into spatiality which is nothing but separateness thusall intellect since it separates tends to geometry and logic which deals with concepts that liewholly outside each other is really an outcome of geometry following the direction of materiality both deduction and induction require spatial intuition behind them the movement at the end ofwhich is spatiality lays down along its course the faculty of induction as well as that of deductionin fact intellectuality entire it creates them in mind and also the order in things which theintellect finds there thus logic and mathematics do not represent a positive spiritual effort but amere somnambulism in which the will is suspended and the mind is no longer active incapacityfor mathematics is therefore a sign of gracefortunately a very common one as intellect is connected with space so instinct or intuition is connected with time it is one of thenoteworthy features of bergsons philosophy that unlike most writers he regards time and spaceas profoundly dissimilar space the characteristic of matter arises from a dissection of the fluxwhich is really illusory useful up to a certain point in practice but utterly misleading in theory time on the contrary is the essential characteristic of life or mind wherever anything lives hesays there is open somewhere a register in which time is being inscribed but the time herespoken

stants mathematical time according to bergson is really a form of space the time which is of theessence of life is what he calls duration this conception of duration is fundamental in hisphilosophy it appears already in his earliest book time and free will and it is necessary tounderstand it if we are to have any comprehension of his system it is however a very difficultconception i do not fully understand it myself and therefore i cannot hope to explain it with allthe lucidity which it doubtless deserves pure duration we are told is the form which our conscious states assume when our ego letsitself live when it refrains from separating its present state from its former states it forms thepast and the present into one organic whole where there is mutual penetration succession withoutdistinction within our ego there is succession without mutual externality outside the ego inpure space there is mutual externality without succession questions relating to subject and object to their distinction and their union should be put interms of time rather than of space in the duration in which we see ourselves acting there aredissociated elements but in the duration in which we act our states melt into each other pureduration is what is most removed from externality and least penetrated with externality a durationin which the past is big with a present absolutely new but then our will is strained to the utmostwe have to gather up the past which is slipping away and thrust it whole and undivided into thepresent at such moments we truly possess ourselves but such moments are rare duration is thevery stuff of reality which is perpetual becoming never something made it is above all in memory that duration exhibits itself for in memory the past survives in thepresent thus the theory of memory becomes of great importance in bergsons philosophy matterand memory is concerned to show the relation of mind and matter of which both are affirmed tobe real by an analysis of memory which is just the intersection of mind and matter there are he says two radically different things both of which are commonly called memory thedistinction between these two is much emphasised by bergson the past survives he saysunder two distinct forms first in motor mechanisms secondly in independent recollectionsfor example a man is said to remember a poem if he can repeat it by heart that is to say if he has acquired a certain habit or mechanismenabling him to repeat a former action but he might at least theoretically be able to repeat thepoem without any recollection of the previous occasions on which he has read it thus there is noconsciousness of past events involved in this sort of memory the second sort which alone reallydeserves to be called memory is exhibited in recollections of separate occasions when he has readthe poem each unique and with a date here he thinks there can be no question of habit sinceeach event only occurred once and had to make its impression immediately it is suggested that insome way everything that has happened to us is remembered but as a rule only what is usefulcomes into consciousness apparent failures of memory it is argued are not really failures of themental part of memory but of the motor mechanism for bringing memory into action this view issupported by a discussion of brain physiology and the facts of amnesia from which it is held toresult that true memory is not a function of the brain the past must be acted by matter imaginedby mind memory is not an emanation of matter indeed the contrary would be nearer the truth ifwe mean matter as grasped in concrete perception which always occupies a certain duration memory must be in principle a power absolutely independent of matter if then spirit is areality it is here in the phenomena of memory that we may come into touch with itexperimentally at the opposite end from pure memory bergson places pure perception in regard to which headopts an ultrarealist position in pure perception he says we are actually placed outsideourselves we touch the reality of the object in an immediate intuition so completely does heidentify perception with its object that he almost refuses to call it mental at all pure perceptionhe says which is the lowest degree of mindmind without memoryis really part of matter aswe understand matter pure perception is constituted by dawning action its actuality lies in itsactivity it is in this way that the brain becomes relevant to perception for the brain is not aninstrument of action the function of the brain is to limit our mental life to what is practicallyuseful but for the brain one gathers everything would be perceived but in fact we only perceivewhat interests us the body always turned towards action has for its essential 
it must not be supposed that their reasons for their theories were wholly empirical the atomictheory was revived in modern times to explain the facts of chemistry but these facts were notknown to the greeks there was no very sharp distinction in ancient times between empiricalobservation and logical argument parmenides it is true treated observed facts with contemptbut empedocles and anaxagoras would combine much of their metaphysics with observationson waterclocks and whirling buckets until the sophists no philosopher seems to have doubtedthat a complete metaphysic and cosmology could be established by a combination of muchreasoning and some observation by good luck the atomists hit on a hypothesis for which morethan two thousand years later some evidence was found but their belief in their day was nonethe less destitute of any solid foundation like the other philosophers of his time leucippus was concerned to find a way of reconcilingthe arguments of parmenides with the obvious fact of motion and change as aristotle says although these opinions those of parmenides appear to follow logically in a dialecticaldiscussion yet to believe them seems next door to madness when one considers the facts forindeed no lunatic seems to be so far out of his senses as to suppose that fire and ice are one itis only between what is right and what seems right from habit that some people are mad enoughto see no difference leucippus however thought he had a theory which harmonized with senseperception andwould not abolish either comingtobe and passingaway or motion and the multiplicity ofthings he made these concessions to the facts of perception on the other hand he conceded tothe monists that there could be no motion without a void the result is a theory which he statesas follows the void is a notbeing and no part of what is is a notbeing for what is in thestrict sense of the term is an absolute plenum this plenum however is not one on thecontrary it is a many infinite in number and invisible owing to the minuteness of their bulk the many move in the void and by coming together they produce comingtobe while by separating they pro  on the logical and mathematical grounds for the theories of the atomists see gaston milhaud les philosophes gomtres de la grce ch iv on generation and corruption a duce passingaway moreover they act and suffer action whenever they chance to be in contact and they generate by being put together and becoming intertwined from the genuinely one on the other hand there could never have come to be a multiplicitynor from the genuinely many a one that is impossible it will be seen that there was one point on which everybody so far was agreed namely that therecould be no motion in a plenum in this all alike were mistaken there can be cyclic motion ina plenum provided it has always existed the idea was that a thing could only move into anempty place and that in a plenum there are no empty places it might be contended perhapsvalidly that motion could never begin in a plenum but it cannot be validly maintained that itcould not occur at all to the greeks however it seemed that one must either acquiesce in theunchanging world of parmenides or admit the void now the arguments of parmenides against notbeing seemed logically irrefutable against thevoid and they were reinforced by the discovery that where there seems to be nothing there isair we may put the parmenidean position in this way you say there is the void therefore the voidis not nothing therefore it is not the void it cannot be said that the atomists answered thisargument they merely proclaimed that they proposed to ignore it on the ground that motion is afact of experience and therefore there must be a void however difficult it may be to conceive let us consider the subsequent history of this problem the first and most obvious way ofavoiding the logical difficulty is to distinguish between matter and space according to thisview space is not nothing but is of the nature of a receptacle which may or may not have anygiven part filled with matter aristotle says the theory that the void existsinvolves the existence of place for  bailey maintains on the contrary that leucippus had an answer which wasextremely subtle it consisted essentially in admitting the existence of something which was not corporeal similarly burnet says it is a curious fact that the atomists who are commonly regarded as the great materialists of antiquity were actuallythe first to say distinctly that a thing might be real without being a body

function to limit with a view to action the life of the spirit it is in fact an instrument of choice we must now return to the subject of instinct or intuition as opposed to intellect it was necessaryfirst to give some account of duration and memory since bergsons theories of duration andmemory are presupposed in this account of intuition in man as he now exists intuition is thefringe or penumbra of intellect it has been thrust out of the centre by being less useful in actionthan intellect but it has deeper uses which make it desirable to bring it back into greaterprominence bergson wishes to make intellect turn inwards on itself and awaken thepotentialities of intuition which still slumber within it the relation between instinct and intellectis compared to that between sight and touch intellect we are told will not give knowledge ofthings at a distance indeed the function of science is said to be to explain all perceptions in termsof touch instinct alone he says is knowledge at a distance it has the same relation to intelligence thatvision has to touch we may observe in passing that as appears in many passages bergson is astrong visualizer whose thought is always conducted by means of visual images the essential characteristic of intuition is that it does not divide the world into separate things asthe intellect does although bergson does not use these words we might describe it as syntheticrather than analytic it apprehends a multiplicity but a multiplicity of interpenetrating processesnot of spatially external bodies there are in truth no things things and states are only viewstaken by our mind of becoming there are no things there are only actions this view of theworld which appears difficult and unnatural to intellect is easy and natural to intuition memoryaffords no instance of what is meant for in memory the past lives on into the present andinterpenetrates it apart from mind the world would be perpetually dying and being born againthe past would have no reality and therefore there would be no past it is memory with itscorrelative desire that makes the past and the future real and therefore creates true duration andtrue time intuition alone can understand this mingling of past and future to the intellect theyremain external spatially external as it were to one another under the guidance of intuition weperceive that form is only a snapshot view of a transition and the philosopher will see thematerial world melt back into a single flux closely connected with the merits of intuition are bergsons doctrine of freedom and his praise ofaction in reality he says a living being is a centre of action it represents a certain sum ofcontingency entering into the world that is to say a certain quantity of possible action thearguments against free will depend partly upon assuming that the intensity of psychical states is aquantity capable at least in theory of numerical measurement this view bergson undertakes torefute in the first chapter of time and free will partly the determinist depends we are told upona confusion between true duration and mathematical time which bergson regards as really a formof space partly again the determinist rests his case upon the unwarranted assumption that whenthe state of the brain is given the state of the mind is theoretically determined bergson is willingto admit that the converse is true that is to say that the state of brain is determinate when the stateof mind is given but he regards the mind as more differentiated than the brain and therefore holdsthat many different states of mind may correspond to one state of brain he concludes that realfreedom is possible we are free when our acts spring from our whole personality when theyexpress it when they have that indefinable resemblance to it which one sometimes finds betweenthe artist and his work in the above outline i have in the main endeavoured merely to state bergsons views withoutgiving the reasons adduced by him in favour of their truth this is easier than it would be withmost philosophers since as a rule he does not give reasons for his opinions but relies on theirinherent attractiveness and on the charm of an excellent style like advertisers he relies uponpicturesque and varied statement and on apparent explanation of many obscure facts analogiesand similes especially form a very large part of the whole process by which he recommends hisviews to the reader the number of similes for life to be found in his works exceeds the number inany poet known to me life he says is like a shell bursting into fragments which are again shells it is like a sheaf initially it was a tendency to accumulate in a reservoir as do especially thegreen parts of vegetables but the reservoir is to be filled with boiling water from which steam isissuing jets must be gushing out unceasingly of which each falling back is a world againlife appears in its entirety as an immense wave which starting from a centre spreads outwardsand 
closely connected with the merits of intuition are bergsons doctrine of freedom and his praise ofaction in reality he says a living being is a centre of action it represents a certain sum ofcontingency entering into the world that is to say a certain quantity of possible action thearguments against free will depend partly upon assuming that the intensity of psychical states is aquantity capable at least in theory of numerical measurement this view bergson undertakes torefute in the first chapter of time and free will partly the determinist depends we are told upona confusion between true duration and mathematical time which bergson regards as really a formof space partly again the determinist rests his case upon the unwarranted assumption that whenthe state of the brain is given the state of the mind is theoretically determined bergson is willingto admit that the converse is true that is to say that the state of brain is determinate when the stateof mind is given but he regards the mind as more differentiated than the brain and therefore holdsthat many different states of mind may correspond to one state of brain he concludes that realfreedom is possible we are free when our acts spring from our whole personality when theyexpress it when they have that indefinable resemblance to it which one sometimes finds betweenthe artist and his work in the above outline i have in the main endeavoured merely to state bergsons views withoutgiving the reasons adduced by him in favour of their truth this is easier than it would be withmost philosophers since as a rule he does not give reasons for his opinions but relies on theirinherent attractiveness and on the charm of an excellent style like advertisers he relies uponpicturesque and varied statement and on apparent explanation of many obscure facts analogiesand similes especially form a very large part of the whole process by which he recommends hisviews to the reader the number of similes for life to be found in his works exceeds the number inany poet known to me life he says is like a shell bursting into fragments which are again shells it is like a sheaf initially it was a tendency to accumulate in a reservoir as do especially thegreen parts of vegetables but the reservoir is to be filled with boiling water from which steam isissuing jets must be gushing out unceasingly of which each falling back is a world againlife appears in its entirety as an immense wave which starting from a centre spreads outwardsand which on almost the whole of its circumference is stopped and converted into oscillation at onesingle point the obstacle has been forced the impulsion has passed freely then there is the greatclimax in which life is compared to a cavalry charge all organized beings from the humblest tothe highest from the first origins of life to the time in which we are and in all places as in alltimes do but evidence a single impulsion the inverse of the movement of matter and in itselfindivisible all the living hold together and all yield to the same tremendous push the animaltakes its stand on the plant man bestrides animality and the whole of humanity in space and intime is one immense army galloping beside and before and behind each of us in an overwhelmingcharge able to beat down every resistance and to clear many obstacles perhaps even death but a cool critic who feels himself a mere spectator perhaps an unsympathetic spectator of thecharge in which man is mounted upon animality may be inclined to think that calm and carefulthought is hardly compatible with this form of exercise when he is told that thought is a meremeans of action the mere impulse to avoid obstacles in the field he may feel that such a view isbecoming in a cavalry officer but not in a philosopher whose business after all is with thoughthe may feel that in the passion and noise of violent motion there is no room for the fainter musicof reason no leisure for the disinterested contemplation in which greatness is sought not byturbulence but by the greatness of the universe which is mirrored in that case he may be temptedto ask whether there are any reasons for accepting such a restless view of the world and if heasks this question he will find if i am not mistaken that there is no reason whatever for acceptingthis view either in the universe or in the writings of m bergson ii the two foundations of bergsons philosophy in so far as it is more than an imaginative andpoetic view of the world are his doctrines of space and time his doctrine of space is required forhis condemnation of the intellect and if he fails in his condemnation of the intellect the intellectwill succeed in its condemnation of him for between the two 
which on almost the whole of its circumference is stopped and converted into oscillation at onesingle point the obstacle has been forced the impulsion has passed freely then there is the greatclimax in which life is compared to a cavalry charge all organized beings from the humblest tothe highest from the first origins of life to the time in which we are and in all places as in alltimes do but evidence a single impulsion the inverse of the movement of matter and in itselfindivisible all the living hold together and all yield to the same tremendous push the animaltakes its stand on the plant man bestrides animality and the whole of humanity in space and intime is one immense army galloping beside and before and behind each of us in an overwhelmingcharge able to beat down every resistance and to clear many obstacles perhaps even death but a cool critic who feels himself a mere spectator perhaps an unsympathetic spectator of thecharge in which man is mounted upon animality may be inclined to think that calm and carefulthought is hardly compatible with this form of exercise when he is told that thought is a meremeans of action the mere impulse to avoid obstacles in the field he may feel that such a view isbecoming in a cavalry officer but not in a philosopher whose business after all is with thoughthe may feel that in the passion and noise of violent motion there is no room for the fainter musicof reason no leisure for the disinterested contemplation in which greatness is sought not byturbulence but by the greatness of the universe which is mirrored in that case he may be temptedto ask whether there are any reasons for accepting such a restless view of the world and if heasks this question he will find if i am not mistaken that there is no reason whatever for acceptingthis view either in the universe or in the writings of m bergson ii the two foundations of bergsons philosophy in so far as it is more than an imaginative andpoetic view of the world are his doctrines of space and time his doctrine of space is required forhis condemnation of the intellect and if he fails in his condemnation of the intellect the intellectwill succeed in its condemnation of him for between the two it is war to the knife his doctrine of time is necessary for his vindication of freedom for hisescape from what william james called a block universe for his doctrine of a perpetual flux inwhich there is nothing that flows and for his whole account of the relations between mind andmatter it will be well therefore in criticism to concentrate on these two doctrines if they aretrue such minor errors and inconsistencies as no philosopher escapes would not greatly matterwhile if they are false nothing remains except an imaginative epic to be judged on aestheticrather than on intellectual grounds i shall begin with the theory of space as being the simpler ofthe two bergsons theory of space occurs fully and explicitly in his time and free will and thereforebelongs to the oldest parts of his philosophy in his first chapter he contends that greater and lessimply space since he regards the greater as essentially that which contains the less he offers noarguments whatever either good or bad in favour of this view he merely exclaims as though hewere giving an obvious reductio ad absurdum as if one could still speak of magnitude wherethere is neither multiplicity nor space the obvious cases to the contrary such as pleasure andpain afford him much difficulty yet he never doubts or reexamines the dogma with which hestarts in his next chapter he maintains the same thesis as regards number as soon as we wish topicture number to ourselves he says and not merely figures or words we are compelled to haverecourse to an extended image and every clear idea of number implies a visual image in spacethese two sentences suffice to show as i shall try to prove that bergson does not know whatnumber is and has himself no clear idea of it this is shown also by his definition number maybe defined in general as a collection of units or speaking more exactly as the synthesis of the oneand the many in discussing these statements i must ask the readers patience for a moment while i call attentionto some distinctions which may at first appear pedantic but are really vital there are threeentirely different things which are confused by bergson in the above statements namely number the general concept applicable to the various particular numbers the variousparticular numbers the various collections to which the various particular numbers areapplicable it is this last that is defined by bergson when he says that number is a collection ofunits the twelve apostles the twelve tribes 
it is war to the knife his doctrine of time is necessary for his vindication of freedom for hisescape from what william james called a block universe for his doctrine of a perpetual flux inwhich there is nothing that flows and for his whole account of the relations between mind andmatter it will be well therefore in criticism to concentrate on these two doctrines if they aretrue such minor errors and inconsistencies as no philosopher escapes would not greatly matterwhile if they are false nothing remains except an imaginative epic to be judged on aestheticrather than on intellectual grounds i shall begin with the theory of space as being the simpler ofthe two bergsons theory of space occurs fully and explicitly in his time and free will and thereforebelongs to the oldest parts of his philosophy in his first chapter he contends that greater and lessimply space since he regards the greater as essentially that which contains the less he offers noarguments whatever either good or bad in favour of this view he merely exclaims as though hewere giving an obvious reductio ad absurdum as if one could still speak of magnitude wherethere is neither multiplicity nor space the obvious cases to the contrary such as pleasure andpain afford him much difficulty yet he never doubts or reexamines the dogma with which hestarts in his next chapter he maintains the same thesis as regards number as soon as we wish topicture number to ourselves he says and not merely figures or words we are compelled to haverecourse to an extended image and every clear idea of number implies a visual image in spacethese two sentences suffice to show as i shall try to prove that bergson does not know whatnumber is and has himself no clear idea of it this is shown also by his definition number maybe defined in general as a collection of units or speaking more exactly as the synthesis of the oneand the many in discussing these statements i must ask the readers patience for a moment while i call attentionto some distinctions which may at first appear pedantic but are really vital there are threeentirely different things which are confused by bergson in the above statements namely number the general concept applicable to the various particular numbers the variousparticular numbers the various collections to which the various particular numbers areapplicable it is this last that is defined by bergson when he says that number is a collection ofunits the twelve apostles the twelve tribes of israel the twelve months the twelve signs of the zodiac are all collections of units yet no oneof them is the number still less is it number in general as by the above definition it ought tobe the number obviously is something which all these collections have in common butwhich they do not have in common with other collections such as cricket elevens hence thenumber is neither a collection of twelve terms nor is it something which all collections have incommon and number in general is a property of or or any other number but not of thevarious collections that have twelve terms or eleven terms hence when following bergsons advice we have recourse to an extended image and picturesay twelve dots such as are obtained by throwing double sixes at dice we have still not obtained apicture of the number the number in fact is something more abstract than any picture before we can be said to have any understanding of the number we must know what differentcollections of twelve units have in common and this is something which cannot be picturedbecause it is abstract bergson only succeeds in making his theory of number plausible byconfusing a particular collection with the number of its terms and this again with number ingeneral the confusion is the same as if we confused a particular young man with youth and youth withthe general concept period of human life and were then to argue that because a young man hastwo legs youth must have two legs and the general concept period of human life must have twolegs the confusion is important because as soon as it is perceived the theory that number orparticular numbers can be pictured in space is seen to be untenable this not only disproves bergsons theory as to number but also his more general theory that all abstract ideas and all logicare derived from space but apart from the question of numbers shall we admit bergsons contention that every pluralityof separate units involves space some of the cases that appear to contradict this view areconsidered by him for example successive sounds when we hear the steps of a passerby in thestreet he says we visualise his successive positions when we hear the strokes of a bell we eitherpicture it swinging backwards and forwards or we range the successive sounds in an ideal space but these are mere autobiographical observations of a visualizer and illustrate the remark wemade before that bergsons views depend upon 
of israel the twelve months the twelve signs of the zodiac are all collections of units yet no oneof them is the number still less is it number in general as by the above definition it ought tobe the number obviously is something which all these collections have in common butwhich they do not have in common with other collections such as cricket elevens hence thenumber is neither a collection of twelve terms nor is it something which all collections have incommon and number in general is a property of or or any other number but not of thevarious collections that have twelve terms or eleven terms hence when following bergsons advice we have recourse to an extended image and picturesay twelve dots such as are obtained by throwing double sixes at dice we have still not obtained apicture of the number the number in fact is something more abstract than any picture before we can be said to have any understanding of the number we must know what differentcollections of twelve units have in common and this is something which cannot be picturedbecause it is abstract bergson only succeeds in making his theory of number plausible byconfusing a particular collection with the number of its terms and this again with number ingeneral the confusion is the same as if we confused a particular young man with youth and youth withthe general concept period of human life and were then to argue that because a young man hastwo legs youth must have two legs and the general concept period of human life must have twolegs the confusion is important because as soon as it is perceived the theory that number orparticular numbers can be pictured in space is seen to be untenable this not only disproves bergsons theory as to number but also his more general theory that all abstract ideas and all logicare derived from space but apart from the question of numbers shall we admit bergsons contention that every pluralityof separate units involves space some of the cases that appear to contradict this view areconsidered by him for example successive sounds when we hear the steps of a passerby in thestreet he says we visualise his successive positions when we hear the strokes of a bell we eitherpicture it swinging backwards and forwards or we range the successive sounds in an ideal space but these are mere autobiographical observations of a visualizer and illustrate the remark wemade before that bergsons views depend upon the predominance of the sense of sight in him there is no logical necessity to range the strokes ofa clock in an imaginary space most people i imagine count them without any spatial auxiliary yet no reason is alleged by bergson for the view that space is necessary he assumes this asobvious and proceeds at once to apply it to the case of times where there seem to be differenttimes outside each other he says the times are pictured as spread out in space in real time suchas is given by memory different times interpenetrate each other and cannot be counted becausethey are not separate the view that all separateness implies space is now supposed established and is used deductivelyto prove that space is involved wherever there is obviously separateness however little otherreason there may be for suspecting such a thing thus abstract ideas for example obviouslyexclude each other whiteness is different from blackness health is different from sickness follyis different from wisdom hence all abstract ideas involve space and therefore logic which usesabstract ideas is an offshoot of geometry and the whole of the intellect depends upon a supposedhabit of picturing things side by side in space this conclusion upon which bergsons wholecondemnation of the intellect rests is based so far as can be discovered entirely upon a personalidiosyncrasy mistaken for a necessity of thought i mean the idiosyncrasy of visualizingsuccessions as spread out on a line the instance of numbers shows that if bergson were in theright we could never have attained to the abstract ideas which are supposed to be thusimpregnated with space and conversely the fact that we can understand abstract ideas seems sufficient to prove that he is wrong inregarding the intellect as impregnated with space one of the bad effects of an antiintellectual philosophy such asthat of bergson is that it thrivesupon the errors and confusions of the intellect hence it is led to prefer bad thinking to good todeclare every momentary difficulty insoluble and to regard every foolish mistake as revealing thebankruptcy of intellect and the triumph of intuition there are in bergsons works many allusionsto mathematics and science and to a careless reader these allusions may seem to strengthen hisphilosophy greatly as regards science especially biology and physiology i am not competent tocriticize his interpretations but as regards mathematics he has deliberately preferred tra 
the predominance of the sense of sight in him there is no logical necessity to range the strokes ofa clock in an imaginary space most people i imagine count them without any spatial auxiliary yet no reason is alleged by bergson for the view that space is necessary he assumes this asobvious and proceeds at once to apply it to the case of times where there seem to be differenttimes outside each other he says the times are pictured as spread out in space in real time suchas is given by memory different times interpenetrate each other and cannot be counted becausethey are not separate the view that all separateness implies space is now supposed established and is used deductivelyto prove that space is involved wherever there is obviously separateness however little otherreason there may be for suspecting such a thing thus abstract ideas for example obviouslyexclude each other whiteness is different from blackness health is different from sickness follyis different from wisdom hence all abstract ideas involve space and therefore logic which usesabstract ideas is an offshoot of geometry and the whole of the intellect depends upon a supposedhabit of picturing things side by side in space this conclusion upon which bergsons wholecondemnation of the intellect rests is based so far as can be discovered entirely upon a personalidiosyncrasy mistaken for a necessity of thought i mean the idiosyncrasy of visualizingsuccessions as spread out on a line the instance of numbers shows that if bergson were in theright we could never have attained to the abstract ideas which are supposed to be thusimpregnated with space and conversely the fact that we can understand abstract ideas seems sufficient to prove that he is wrong inregarding the intellect as impregnated with space one of the bad effects of an antiintellectual philosophy such asthat of bergson is that it thrivesupon the errors and confusions of the intellect hence it is led to prefer bad thinking to good todeclare every momentary difficulty insoluble and to regard every foolish mistake as revealing thebankruptcy of intellect and the triumph of intuition there are in bergsons works many allusionsto mathematics and science and to a careless reader these allusions may seem to strengthen hisphilosophy greatly as regards science especially biology and physiology i am not competent tocriticize his interpretations but as regards mathematics he has deliberately preferred tra ditional errors in interpretation to the more modern views which have prevailed amongmathematicians for the last eighty years in this matter he has followed the example of mostphilosophers in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the infinitesimal calculus thoughwell developed as a method was supported as regards its foundations by many fallacies andmuch confused thinking hegel and his followers seized upon these fallacies and confusions tosupport them in their attempt to prove all mathematics selfcontradictory thence the hegelianaccount of these matters passed into the current thought of philosophers where it has remainedlong after the mathematicians have removed all the difficulties upon which the philosophers rely and so long as the main object of philosophers is to show that nothing can be learned by patienceand detailed thinking but that we ought rather to worship the prejudices of the ignorant under thetitle of reason if we are hegelians or of intuition if we are bergsonians so long philosopherswill take care to remain ignorant of what mathematicians have done to remove the errors by which hegel profited apart from the question of number which we have already considered the chief point at which bergson touches mathematics is his rejection of what he calls the cinematographicrepresentation of the world mathematics conceives change even continuous change asconstituted by a series of states bergson on the contrary contends that no series of states canrepresent what is continuous and that in change a thing is never in any state at all the view thatchange is constituted by a series of changing states he calls cinematographic this view he says isnatural to the intellect but is radically vicious true change can only be explained by trueduration it involves an interpenetration of past and present not a mathematical succession ofstatic states this is what is called a dynamic instead of a static view of the world thequestion is important and in spite of its difficulty we cannot pass it by bergsons position is illustratedand what is to be said in criticism may also be aptly illustratedby zenos argument of the arrow zeno argues that since the arrow at each moment simply iswhere it is therefore the arrow in its flight is always at rest at first sight this argument may notappear a very powerful one of course it will be said the arrow is where it is at one moment butat another moment it is somewhere else and this is just what constitutes motion certain 
ditional errors in interpretation to the more modern views which have prevailed amongmathematicians for the last eighty years in this matter he has followed the example of mostphilosophers in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the infinitesimal calculus thoughwell developed as a method was supported as regards its foundations by many fallacies andmuch confused thinking hegel and his followers seized upon these fallacies and confusions tosupport them in their attempt to prove all mathematics selfcontradictory thence the hegelianaccount of these matters passed into the current thought of philosophers where it has remainedlong after the mathematicians have removed all the difficulties upon which the philosophers rely and so long as the main object of philosophers is to show that nothing can be learned by patienceand detailed thinking but that we ought rather to worship the prejudices of the ignorant under thetitle of reason if we are hegelians or of intuition if we are bergsonians so long philosopherswill take care to remain ignorant of what mathematicians have done to remove the errors by which hegel profited apart from the question of number which we have already considered the chief point at which bergson touches mathematics is his rejection of what he calls the cinematographicrepresentation of the world mathematics conceives change even continuous change asconstituted by a series of states bergson on the contrary contends that no series of states canrepresent what is continuous and that in change a thing is never in any state at all the view thatchange is constituted by a series of changing states he calls cinematographic this view he says isnatural to the intellect but is radically vicious true change can only be explained by trueduration it involves an interpenetration of past and present not a mathematical succession ofstatic states this is what is called a dynamic instead of a static view of the world thequestion is important and in spite of its difficulty we cannot pass it by bergsons position is illustratedand what is to be said in criticism may also be aptly illustratedby zenos argument of the arrow zeno argues that since the arrow at each moment simply iswhere it is therefore the arrow in its flight is always at rest at first sight this argument may notappear a very powerful one of course it will be said the arrow is where it is at one moment butat another moment it is somewhere else and this is just what constitutes motion certain difficulties it is true arise out of the continuity of motion if we insist upon assuming that motionis also discontinuous these difficulties thus obtained have long been part of the stockintradeof philosophers but if with the mathematicians we avoid the assumption that motion is alsodiscontinuous we shall not fall into the philosophers difficulties a cinematograph in which thereare an infinite number of pictures and in which there is never a next picture because an infinitenumber come between any two will perfectly represent a continuous motion wherein then liesthe force of zenos argument zeno belonged to the eleatic school whose object was to prove that there could be no such thingas change the natural view to take of the world is that there are things which change forexample there is an arrow which is now here now there by bisection of this view philosophershave developed two paradoxes the eleatics said that there were things but no changes heraclitusand bergson said there were changes but no things the eleatics said there was an arrow but noflight heraclitus and bergson said there was a flight but no arrow each party conducted itsargument by refutation of the other party how ridiculous to say there is no arrow say the staticparty how ridiculous to say there is no flight say the dynamic party the unfortunate man whostands in the middle and maintains that there is both the arrow and its flight is assumed by thedisputants to deny both he is therefore pierced like saint sebastian by the arrow from one sideand by its flight from the other but we have still not discovered wherein lies the force of zenosargument zeno assumes tacitly the essence of the bergsonian theory of change that is to say he assumesthat when a thing is in a process of continuous change even if it is only change of position theremust be in the thing some internal state of change the thing must at each instant be intrinsicallydifferent from what it would be if it were not changing he then points out that at each instant thearrow simply is where it is just as it would be if it were at rest hence he concludes that there canbe no such thing as a state of motion and therefore adhering to the view that a state of motion isessential to motion he infers that there can be no motion and that the arrow is always at rest zenos argument therefore though it does not touch the mathematical account of change doesprima facie refute a view of change which is not unlike bergsons how then does bergson meet 
difficulties it is true arise out of the continuity of motion if we insist upon assuming that motionis also discontinuous these difficulties thus obtained have long been part of the stockintradeof philosophers but if with the mathematicians we avoid the assumption that motion is alsodiscontinuous we shall not fall into the philosophers difficulties a cinematograph in which thereare an infinite number of pictures and in which there is never a next picture because an infinitenumber come between any two will perfectly represent a continuous motion wherein then liesthe force of zenos argument zeno belonged to the eleatic school whose object was to prove that there could be no such thingas change the natural view to take of the world is that there are things which change forexample there is an arrow which is now here now there by bisection of this view philosophershave developed two paradoxes the eleatics said that there were things but no changes heraclitusand bergson said there were changes but no things the eleatics said there was an arrow but noflight heraclitus and bergson said there was a flight but no arrow each party conducted itsargument by refutation of the other party how ridiculous to say there is no arrow say the staticparty how ridiculous to say there is no flight say the dynamic party the unfortunate man whostands in the middle and maintains that there is both the arrow and its flight is assumed by thedisputants to deny both he is therefore pierced like saint sebastian by the arrow from one sideand by its flight from the other but we have still not discovered wherein lies the force of zenosargument zeno assumes tacitly the essence of the bergsonian theory of change that is to say he assumesthat when a thing is in a process of continuous change even if it is only change of position theremust be in the thing some internal state of change the thing must at each instant be intrinsicallydifferent from what it would be if it were not changing he then points out that at each instant thearrow simply is where it is just as it would be if it were at rest hence he concludes that there canbe no such thing as a state of motion and therefore adhering to the view that a state of motion isessential to motion he infers that there can be no motion and that the arrow is always at rest zenos argument therefore though it does not touch the mathematical account of change doesprima facie refute a view of change which is not unlike bergsons how then does bergson meet zenos argument he meets it by denying that the arrow is ever anywhere after stating zenosargument he replies yes if we suppose that the arrow can ever be in a point of its course yesagain if the arrow which is moving ever coincides with a position which is motionless but thearrow never is in any point of its course this reply to zeno or a closely similar one concerning achilles and the tortoise occurs in all his three books bergsons view plainly is paradoxicalwhether it is possible is a question which demands a discussion of his view of duration his onlyargument in its favor is the statement that the mathematical view of change implies the absurdproposition that movement is made of immobilities but the apparent absurdity of this view ismerely due to the verbal form in which he has stated it and vanishes as soon as we realize thatmotion implies relations a friendship for example is made out of people who are friends butnot out of friendships a genealogy is made out of men but not out of genealogies so a motion ismade out of what is moving but not out of motions it expresses the fact that a thing may be indifferent places at different times and that the places may still be different however near togetherthe times may be bergsons argument against the mathematical view of motion therefore reducesitself in the last analysis to a mere play upon words and with this conclusion we may pass on toa criticism of his theory of duration bergsons theory of duration is bound up with his theory of memory according to this theorythings remembered survive in memory and thus interpenetrate present things past and present arenot mutually external but are mingled in the unity of consciousness action he says is whatconstitutes being but mathematical time is a mere passive receptacle which does nothing andtherefore is nothing the past he says is that which acts no longer and the present is that which isacting but in this statement as indeed throughout his account of duration bergson isunconsciously assuming the ordinary mathematical time without this his statements areunmeaning what is meant by saying the past is essentially that which acts no longer except that the past is that of which the action is past the words no longer are wordsexpressive of the past to a person who did not have the ordinary notion of the past as somethingoutside the present these words would have no meaning thus his definition is circular what hesays is in effect the past is that of which the 
zenos argument he meets it by denying that the arrow is ever anywhere after stating zenosargument he replies yes if we suppose that the arrow can ever be in a point of its course yesagain if the arrow which is moving ever coincides with a position which is motionless but thearrow never is in any point of its course this reply to zeno or a closely similar one concerning achilles and the tortoise occurs in all his three books bergsons view plainly is paradoxicalwhether it is possible is a question which demands a discussion of his view of duration his onlyargument in its favor is the statement that the mathematical view of change implies the absurdproposition that movement is made of immobilities but the apparent absurdity of this view ismerely due to the verbal form in which he has stated it and vanishes as soon as we realize thatmotion implies relations a friendship for example is made out of people who are friends butnot out of friendships a genealogy is made out of men but not out of genealogies so a motion ismade out of what is moving but not out of motions it expresses the fact that a thing may be indifferent places at different times and that the places may still be different however near togetherthe times may be bergsons argument against the mathematical view of motion therefore reducesitself in the last analysis to a mere play upon words and with this conclusion we may pass on toa criticism of his theory of duration bergsons theory of duration is bound up with his theory of memory according to this theorythings remembered survive in memory and thus interpenetrate present things past and present arenot mutually external but are mingled in the unity of consciousness action he says is whatconstitutes being but mathematical time is a mere passive receptacle which does nothing andtherefore is nothing the past he says is that which acts no longer and the present is that which isacting but in this statement as indeed throughout his account of duration bergson isunconsciously assuming the ordinary mathematical time without this his statements areunmeaning what is meant by saying the past is essentially that which acts no longer except that the past is that of which the action is past the words no longer are wordsexpressive of the past to a person who did not have the ordinary notion of the past as somethingoutside the present these words would have no meaning thus his definition is circular what hesays is in effect the past is that of which the action is in the past as a definition this cannot be regarded as a happy effort and the sameapplies to the present the present we are told is that which is acting but the wordis introduces just that idea of the present which was to be defined the present is that which isacting as opposed to that which was acting or will be acting that is to say the present is thatwhose action is in the present not in the past or in the future again the definition is circular anearlier passage on the same page will illustrate the fallacy further that which constitutes ourpure perception he says is our dawning action  the actuality of our perception thus lies inits activity in the movements which prolong it and not in its greater intensity the past is onlyidea the present is ideomotor this passage makes it quite clear that when bergson speaks ofthe past he does not mean the past but our present memory of the past the past when it existedwas just as active as the present is now if bergsons account were correct the present momentought to be the only one in the whole history of the world containing any activity in earlier timesthere were other perceptions just as active just as actual in their day as our present perceptionsthe past in its day was by no means only idea but was in its intrinsic character just what thepresent is now this real past however bergson simply forgets what he speaks of is the presentidea of the past the real past does not mingle with the present since it is not part of it but that isa very different thing the whole of bergsons theory of duration and time rests throughout on the elementary confusionbetween the present occurrence of a recollection and the past occurrence which is recollected butfor the fact that time is so familiar to us the vicious circle involved in his attempt to deduce thepast as what is no longer active would be obvious at once as it is what bergson gives is anaccount of the difference between perception and recollectionboth present factsand what hebelieves himself to have given is an account of the difference between the present and the past assoon as this confusion is realized his theory of time is seen to be simply a theory which omitstime altogether the confusion between present remembering and the past event remembered which seems to beat the bottom of bergsons theory of time is an instance of a more general confusion which if iam not mistaken vitiates a great deal of his thought and indeed a great deal 
duce passingaway moreover they act and suffer action whenever they chance to be in contact and they generate by being put together and becoming intertwined from the genuinely one on the other hand there could never have come to be a multiplicitynor from the genuinely many a one that is impossible it will be seen that there was one point on which everybody so far was agreed namely that therecould be no motion in a plenum in this all alike were mistaken there can be cyclic motion ina plenum provided it has always existed the idea was that a thing could only move into anempty place and that in a plenum there are no empty places it might be contended perhapsvalidly that motion could never begin in a plenum but it cannot be validly maintained that itcould not occur at all to the greeks however it seemed that one must either acquiesce in theunchanging world of parmenides or admit the void now the arguments of parmenides against notbeing seemed logically irrefutable against thevoid and they were reinforced by the discovery that where there seems to be nothing there isair we may put the parmenidean position in this way you say there is the void therefore the voidis not nothing therefore it is not the void it cannot be said that the atomists answered thisargument they merely proclaimed that they proposed to ignore it on the ground that motion is afact of experience and therefore there must be a void however difficult it may be to conceive let us consider the subsequent history of this problem the first and most obvious way ofavoiding the logical difficulty is to distinguish between matter and space according to thisview space is not nothing but is of the nature of a receptacle which may or may not have anygiven part filled with matter aristotle says the theory that the void existsinvolves the existence of place for  bailey maintains on the contrary that leucippus had an answer which wasextremely subtle it consisted essentially in admitting the existence of something which was not corporeal similarly burnet says it is a curious fact that the atomists who are commonly regarded as the great materialists of antiquity were actuallythe first to say distinctly that a thing might be real without being a body one would define void as place bereft of body this view is set forth with the utmost explicitnessby newton who asserts the existence of absolute space and accordingly distinguishes absolutefrom relative motion in the copernican controversy both sides were committed to this view since they thought there was a difference between sayingthe heavens revolve from east to west and saying the earth rotates from west to east if allmotion is relative these two statements are merely different ways of saying the same thing like john is the father of james and james is the son of john but if all motion is relative andspace is not substantial we are left with the parmenidean arguments against the void on ourhands descartes whose arguments are of just the same sort as those of early greek philosophers saidthat extension is the essence of matter and therefore there is matter everywhere for himextension is an adjective not a substantive its substantive is matter and without its substantive itcannot exist empty space to him is as absurd as happiness without a sentient being who ishappy leibniz on somewhat different grounds also believed in the plenum but he maintainedthat space is merely a system of relations on this subject there was a famous controversy betweenhim and newton the latter represented by clarke the controversy remained undecided until thetime of einstein whose theory conclusively gave the victory to leibniz the modern physicist while he still believes that matter is in some sense atomic does not believein empty space where there is not matter there is still something notably lightwaves matter nolonger has the lofty status that it acquired in philosophy through the arguments of parmenides it isnot unchanging substance but merely a way of grouping events some events belong to groupsthat can be regarded as material things others such as lightwaves do not it is the events that arethe stuff of the world and each of them is of brief duration in this respect modern physics is onthe side of heraclitus as against parmenides but it was on the side of parmenides until einsteinand quantum theory as regards space the modern view is that it is neither a substance as newton maintained and as leucippus and democritus ought to have said nor an adjective of extended bodies as descartesthought

of the thought of most modern philosophersi mean the confusion between an act of knowing andthat which is known in memory the act of knowing is in the present whereas what is known is inthe past thus by confusing them the distinction between past and present is blurred throughout matter and memory this confusion between the act of knowing and the object knownis indispensable it is enshrined in the use of the word image which is explained at the verybeginning of the book he there states that apart from philosophical theories everything that weknow consists of images which indeed constitute the whole universe he says i call matter theaggregate of images and perception of matter these same images referred to the eventual action ofone particular image my body it will be observed that matter and the perception of matteraccording to him consist of the very same things the brain he says is like the rest of thematerial universe and is therefore an image if the universe is an image since the brain which nobody sees is not in the ordinary sense an image we are not surprised athis saying that an image can be without being perceived but he explains later on that as regardsimages the difference between being and being consciously perceived is only one of degree thisis perhaps explained by another passage in which he says what can be a nonperceived materialobject an image not imaged unless it is a kind of unconscious mental state finally he saysthat every reality has a kinship an analogy in short a relation with consciousnessthis is whatwe concede to idealism by the very fact that we term things images nevertheless he attempts toallay our initial doubt by saying that he is beginning at a point before any of the assumptions ofphilosophers have been introduced we will assume he says for the moment that we knownothing of theories of matter and theories of spirit nothing of the discussions as to the reality orideality of the external world here i am in the presence of images and in the new introductionwhich he wrote for the english edition he says by image we mean a certain existence which ismore than that which the idealist calls a representation but less than that which the realist calls athingan existence placed halfway between the thing and the representation the distinction which bergson has in mind in the above is not i think the distinction between the imaging as a mental occurrence and the thing imaged as anobject he is thinking of the distinction between the thing as it is and thing as it appears thedistinction between subject and object between the mind which thinks and remembers and hasimages on the one hand and the objects thought about remembered or imagedthis distinctionso far as i can see is wholly absent from his philosophy its absence is his real debt to idealismand a very unfortunate debt it is in the case of images as we have just seen it enables him firstto speak of images as neutral between mind and matter then to assert that the brain is an image inspite of the fact that it has never been imaged then to suggest that matter and the perception ofmatter are the same thing but that a nonperceived image is an unconsciousmental state while finally the use of the word image though involving no metaphysicaltheories whatever nevertheless implies that every reality has a kinship an analogy in short arelation with consciousness all these confusions are due to the initial confusion of subjective and objective the subjectathought or an image or a memoryis a present fact in me the object may be the law of gravitationor my friend jones or the old campanile of venice the subject is mental and is here and now therefore if subject and object are one the object is mental and is here and now my friend jonesthough he believes himself to be in south america and to exist on his own account is really in myhead and exists in virtue of my thinking about him st marks campanile in spite of its great sizeand the fact that it ceased to exist forty years ago still exists and is to be found complete insideme these statements are no travesty of bergsons theories of space and time they are merely anattempt to show what is the actual concrete meaning of those theories the confusion of subject and object is not peculiar to bergson but is common to many idealistsand many materialists many idealists say that the object is really the subject and manymaterialists say that the subject is really the object they agree in thinking these two statementsvery different while yet holding that subject and object are not different in this respect we mayadmit bergson has merit for he is as ready to identify subject with object as to identify objectwith subject as soon as this identification is rejected his whole system collapses first histheories of space and time then his belief in 
think the distinction between the imaging as a mental occurrence and the thing imaged as anobject he is thinking of the distinction between the thing as it is and thing as it appears thedistinction between subject and object between the mind which thinks and remembers and hasimages on the one hand and the objects thought about remembered or imagedthis distinctionso far as i can see is wholly absent from his philosophy its absence is his real debt to idealismand a very unfortunate debt it is in the case of images as we have just seen it enables him firstto speak of images as neutral between mind and matter then to assert that the brain is an image inspite of the fact that it has never been imaged then to suggest that matter and the perception ofmatter are the same thing but that a nonperceived image is an unconsciousmental state while finally the use of the word image though involving no metaphysicaltheories whatever nevertheless implies that every reality has a kinship an analogy in short arelation with consciousness all these confusions are due to the initial confusion of subjective and objective the subjectathought or an image or a memoryis a present fact in me the object may be the law of gravitationor my friend jones or the old campanile of venice the subject is mental and is here and now therefore if subject and object are one the object is mental and is here and now my friend jonesthough he believes himself to be in south america and to exist on his own account is really in myhead and exists in virtue of my thinking about him st marks campanile in spite of its great sizeand the fact that it ceased to exist forty years ago still exists and is to be found complete insideme these statements are no travesty of bergsons theories of space and time they are merely anattempt to show what is the actual concrete meaning of those theories the confusion of subject and object is not peculiar to bergson but is common to many idealistsand many materialists many idealists say that the object is really the subject and manymaterialists say that the subject is really the object they agree in thinking these two statementsvery different while yet holding that subject and object are not different in this respect we mayadmit bergson has merit for he is as ready to identify subject with object as to identify objectwith subject as soon as this identification is rejected his whole system collapses first histheories of space and time then his belief in real contingency then his condemnation of intellect and finally his account of the relations ofmind and

goodconduct and his democratic feeling made him unable to acquiesce in the notion of one truth forphilosophers and another for the vulgar the temperamental opposition between protestant and catholic persists among the unorthodox santayana was a catholic freethinker william james a protestant however heretical james doctrine of radical empiricism was first published in in an essay called does consciousness exist the main purpose of this essay was to deny that the subjectobjectrelation is fundamental it had until then been taken for granted by philosophers that there is akind of occurrence called knowing in which one entity the knower or subject is aware ofanother the thing known or the object the knower was regarded as a mind or soul the objectknown might be a material object an eternal essence another mind or in selfconsciousnessidentical with the knower almost everything in accepted philosophy was bound up with thedualism of subject and object the distinction of mind and matter the contemplative ideal and thetraditional notion of truth all need to be radically reconsidered if the distinction of subject andobject is not accepted as fundamental for my part i am convinced that james was right on this matter and would on this ground alonedeserve a high place among philosophers i had thought otherwise until he and those who agreedwith him persuaded me of the truth of his doctrine but let us proceed to his arguments consciousness he says is the name of a nonentity and has no right to a place among firstprinciples those who still cling to it are clinging to a mere echo the faint rumour left behind bythe disappearing soul upon the air of philosophy there is he continues no aboriginal stuff orquality of being contrasted with that of which material objects are made out of which ourthoughts of them are made he explains that he is not denying that our thoughts perform afunction which is that of knowing and that this function may be called being conscious whathe is denying might be put crudely as the view that consciousness is a thing he holds that thereis only one primal stuff 
dogmas but he was content that others should believe them and himself appreciated what heregarded as the christian myth to james such an attitude could not but appear immoral heretained from his puritan ancestry a deepseated belief that what is of most importance is goodconduct and his democratic feeling made him unable to acquiesce in the notion of one truth forphilosophers and another for the vulgar the temperamental opposition between protestant and catholic persists among the unorthodox santayana was a catholic freethinker william james a protestant however heretical james doctrine of radical empiricism was first published in in an essay called does consciousness exist the main purpose of this essay was to deny that the subjectobjectrelation is fundamental it had until then been taken for granted by philosophers that there is akind of occurrence called knowing in which one entity the knower or subject is aware ofanother the thing known or the object the knower was regarded as a mind or soul the objectknown might be a material object an eternal essence another mind or in selfconsciousnessidentical with the knower almost everything in accepted philosophy was bound up with thedualism of subject and object the distinction of mind and matter the contemplative ideal and thetraditional notion of truth all need to be radically reconsidered if the distinction of subject andobject is not accepted as fundamental for my part i am convinced that james was right on this matter and would on this ground alonedeserve a high place among philosophers i had thought otherwise until he and those who agreedwith him persuaded me of the truth of his doctrine but let us proceed to his arguments consciousness he says is the name of a nonentity and has no right to a place among firstprinciples those who still cling to it are clinging to a mere echo the faint rumour left behind bythe disappearing soul upon the air of philosophy there is he continues no aboriginal stuff orquality of being contrasted with that of which material objects are made out of which ourthoughts of them are made he explains that he is not denying that our thoughts perform afunction which is that of knowing and that this function may be called being conscious whathe is denying might be put crudely as the view that consciousness is a thing he holds that thereis only one primal stuff or material out of which everything in the world is composed this stuff he calls pureexperience knowing he says is a particular sort of relation between two portions of pureexperience the subjectobject relation is derivative experience i believe has no such innerduplicity a given undivided portion of experience can be in one context a knower and inanother something known he defines pure experience as the immediate flux of life which furnishes the material to ourlater reflection it will be seen that this doctrine abolishes the distinction between mind and matter if regarded asa distinction between two different kinds of what james calls stuff accordingly those whoagree with james in this matter advocate what they call neutral monism according to which thematerial of which the world is constructed is neither mind nor matter but something anterior toboth james himself did not develop this implication of his theory on the contrary his use of thephrase pure experience points to a perhaps unconscious berkeleian idealism the wordexperience is one often used by philosophers but seldom defined let us consider for a momentwhat it can mean common sense holds that many things which occur are not experienced for instance events onthe invisible side of the moon berkeley and hegel for different reasons both denied this andmaintained that what is not experienced is nothing their arguments are now held by mostphilosophers to be invalidrightly in my opinion if we are to adhere to the view that the stuffof the world is experience we shall find it necessary to invent elaborate and unplausibleexplanations of what we mean by such things as the invisible side of the moon and unless we areable to infer things not experienced from things experienced we shall have difficulty in findinggrounds for belief in the existence of anything except ourselves james it is true denies this buthis reasons are not very convincing what do we mean by experience the best way to find an answer is to ask what is thedifference between an event which is not experienced and one which is rain seen or felt to befalling is experienced but rain falling in the desert where there is no living thing is notexperienced thus we arrive at our first point there is no experience except where there is life but experience is not coextensive with life many things happen to me which i do not noticethese i can

it is i should say give to any hypothesis which is worth your while to consider just that degreeof credence which the evidence warrants and if the hypothesis is sufficiently important there isthe additional duty of seeking further evidence this is plain common sense and in harmony withthe procedure in the law courts but it is quite different from the procedure recommended by james it would be unfair to james to consider his will to believe in isolation it was a transitionaldoctrine leading by a natural development to pragmatism pragmatism as it appears in james isprimarily a new definition of truth there were two other protagonists of pragmatism fcsschiller and dr john dewey i shall consider dr dewey in the next chapter schiller was of lessimportance than the other two between james and dr dewey there is a difference of emphasis dr deweys outlook is scientific and his arguments are largely derived from an examination ofscientific method but james is concerned primarily with religion and morals roughly speakinghe is prepared to advocate any doctrine which tends to make people virtuous and happy if it doesso it is true in the sense in which he uses that word the principle of pragmatism according to james was first enunciated by c s peirce whomaintained that in order to attain clearness in our thoughts of an object we need only considerwhat conceivable effects of a practical kind the object may involve james in elucidation saysthat the function of philosophy is to find out what difference it makes to you or me if this or thatworldformula is true in this way theories become instruments not answers to enigmas ideas we are told by james become true in so far as they help us to get into satisfactory relationswith other parts of our experience an idea is true so long as to believe it is profitable to ourlives truth is one species of good not a separate category truth happens to an idea it is madetrue by events it is correct to say with the interectualists that a true idea must agree with realitybut agreeing does not mean copying to agree in the widest sense with a reality can onlymean to be guided either straight up to it or into its surroundings or to be put into such workingtouch with it as to handle either it or something connected with it better than if we disagreed headds that the true is only the expedient in the way of our thinking  in the long run and on thewhole of course in other words our obligation to seek truth is part of our general obligation to do what pays in a chapter on pragmatism and religion he reaps the harvest we cannot reject any hypothesis ifconsequences useful to life flow from it if the hypothesis of god works satisfactorily in thewidest sense of the word it is true we may well believe on the proofs that religious experienceaffords that higher powers exist and are at work to save the world on ideal lines similar to ourown i find great intellectual difficulties in this doctrine it assumes that a belief is true when itseffects are good if this definition is to be usefuland if not it is condemned by the pragmatiststestwe must know what is good what are the effects of this or that belief and we mustknow these things before we can know that anything is true since it is only after we havedecided that the effects of a belief are good that we have a right to call it true the result is anincredible complication suppose you want to know whether columbus crossed the atlantic in you must not as other people do look it up in a book you must first inquire what are theeffects of this belief and how they differ from the effects of believing that he sailed in or this is difficult enough but it is still more difficult to weigh the effects from an ethicalpoint of view you may say that obviously has the best effects since it gives you highergrades in examinations but your competitors who would surpass you if you said or may consider your success instead of theirs ethically regrettable apart from examinations icannot think of any practical effects of the belief except in the case of a historian but this is not the end of the trouble you must hold that your estimate of the consequences of abelief both ethical and factual is true for if it is false your argument for the truth of your belief ismistaken but to say that your belief as to consequences is true is according to james to say thatit has good consequences and this in turn is only true if it has good consequences and so on adinfinitum obviously this wont do there is another difficulty suppose i say there was such a person as columbus every one willagree that what i say is true but why is it true because of a certain man of flesh and blood wholived years agoin short because of the causes of my belief not because of its effects with jamess definition it might happen that a exists 
in other words our obligation to seek truth is part of our general obligation to do what pays in a chapter on pragmatism and religion he reaps the harvest we cannot reject any hypothesis ifconsequences useful to life flow from it if the hypothesis of god works satisfactorily in thewidest sense of the word it is true we may well believe on the proofs that religious experienceaffords that higher powers exist and are at work to save the world on ideal lines similar to ourown i find great intellectual difficulties in this doctrine it assumes that a belief is true when itseffects are good if this definition is to be usefuland if not it is condemned by the pragmatiststestwe must know what is good what are the effects of this or that belief and we mustknow these things before we can know that anything is true since it is only after we havedecided that the effects of a belief are good that we have a right to call it true the result is anincredible complication suppose you want to know whether columbus crossed the atlantic in you must not as other people do look it up in a book you must first inquire what are theeffects of this belief and how they differ from the effects of believing that he sailed in or this is difficult enough but it is still more difficult to weigh the effects from an ethicalpoint of view you may say that obviously has the best effects since it gives you highergrades in examinations but your competitors who would surpass you if you said or may consider your success instead of theirs ethically regrettable apart from examinations icannot think of any practical effects of the belief except in the case of a historian but this is not the end of the trouble you must hold that your estimate of the consequences of abelief both ethical and factual is true for if it is false your argument for the truth of your belief ismistaken but to say that your belief as to consequences is true is according to james to say thatit has good consequences and this in turn is only true if it has good consequences and so on adinfinitum obviously this wont do there is another difficulty suppose i say there was such a person as columbus every one willagree that what i say is true but why is it true because of a certain man of flesh and blood wholived years agoin short because of the causes of my belief not because of its effects with jamess definition it might happen that a exists is true although in fact a does not exist i have always found that the hypothesis of santa clausworks satisfactorily in the widest sense of the word therefore santa claus exists is truealthough santa claus does not exist james says if the hypothesis of god workssatisfactorily in the widest sense of the word it is true this simply omits as unimportant thequestion whether god really is in his heaven if he is a useful hypothesis that is enough god the architect of the cosmos is forgotten all that is remembered is belief in god and its effects uponthe creatures inhabiting our petty planet no wonder the pope condemned the pragmatic fence ofreligion we come here to a fundamental difference between jamess religious outlook and that of religiouspeople in the past james is interested in religion as a human phenomenon but shows little interestin the objects which religion contemplates he wants people to be happy and if belief in godmakes them happy let them believe in him this so far is only benevolence not philosophy itbecomes philosophy when it is said that if the belief makes them happy it is true to the manwho desires an object of worship this is unsatisfactory he is not concerned to say if i believed in god i should be happy he is concerned to say i believe in god and therefore i am happy andwhen he believes in god he believes in him as he believes in the existence of roosevelt or churchill or hitler god for him is an actual being not merely a human idea which has goodeffects it is this genuine belief that has the good effects not jamess emasculate substitute it isobvious that if i say hitler exists i do not mean the effects of believing that hitler exists aregood and to the genuine believer the same is true of god jamess doctrine is an attempt to build a superstructure of belief upon a foundation of scepticismand like all such attempts it is dependent on fallacies in his case the fallacies spring from anattempt to ignore all extrahuman facts berkeleian idealism combined with scepticism causes himto substitute belief in god for god and to pretend that this will do just as well but this is only aform of the subjectivistic madness which is characteristic of most modern philosophy 
of pleasure in reasoning analysing and systematizing although in art the renaissance is stillorderly in thought it prefers a large and fruitful disorder in this respect montaigne is the mosttypical exponent of the age in the theory of politics as in everything except art there was a collapse of order the middle ages though turbulent in practice were dominated in thought by a passion for legality and by avery precise theory of political power all power is ultimately from god he has delegated powerto the pope in sacred things and to the emperor in secular matters but pope and emperor alikelost their importance during the fifteenth century the pope became merely one of the italianprinces engaged in the incredibly complicated and unscrupulous game of italian power politics the new national monarchies in france spain and england had in their own territories a powerwith which neither pope nor emperor could interfere the national state largely owing togunpowder acquired an influence over mens thoughts and feelings which it had not had beforeand which progressively destroyed what remained of the roman belief in the unity of civilization this political disorder found expression in machiavelli prince in the absence of any guidingprinciple politics becomes a naked struggle for power the prince gives shrewd advice as to howto play this game successfully what had happened in the great age of greece happened again in renaissance italy traditional moral restraints disappeared because they were seen to beassociated with superstition the liberation from fetters made individuals energetic and creativeproducing a rare florescence of genius but the anarchy and treachery which inevitably resultedfrom the decay of morals made italians collectively impotent and they fell like the greeks underthe domination of nations less civilized than themselves but not so destitute of social cohesion the result however was less disastrous than in the case of greece because the newly powerfulnations with the exception of spain showed themselves as capable of great achievement as the italians had been from the sixteenth century onward the history of european thought is dominated by the reformation the reformation was a complex manysided movement and owed its success to avariety of causes in the main it was a revolt of the northern nations against the renewed dominion of rome religion was the force that had subdued the north but religion in italy had decayed the papacyremained as an institution and extracted a huge tribute from germany and england but thesenations which were still pious could feel no reverence for the borgias and medicis whoprofessed to save souls from purgatory in return for cash which they squandered on luxury andimmorality national motives economic motives and moral motives all combined to strengthenthe revolt against rome moreover the princes soon perceived that if the church in theirterritories became merely national they would be able to dominate it and would thus becomemuch more powerful at home than they had been while sharing dominion with the pope for allthese reasons luthers theological innovations were welcomed by rulers and peoples alikethroughout the greater part of northern europe the catholic church was derived from three sources its sacred history was jewish its theologywas greek its government and canon law were at least indirectly roman the reformationrejected the roman elements softened the greek elements and greatly strengthened the judaicelements it thus cooperated with the nationalist forces which were undoing the work of socialcohesion which had been effected first by the roman empire and then by the roman church in catholic doctrine divine revelation did not end with the scriptures but continued from age to agethrough the medium of the church to which therefore it was the duty of the individual to submithis private opinions protestants on the contrary rejected the church as a vehicle of revelationtruth was to be sought only in the bible which each man could interpret for himself if mendiffered in their interpretation there was no divinely appointed authority to decide the dispute inpractice the state claimed the right that had formerly belonged to the church but this was ausurpation in protestant theory there should be no earthly intermediary between the soul and god the effects of this change were momentous truth was no longer to be ascertained by consultingauthority but by inward meditation there was a tendency quickly developed towards anarchismin politics and in religion towards mysticism which had always fitted with difficulty into theframework of catholic orthodoxy there 
one would define void as place bereft of body this view is set forth with the utmost explicitnessby newton who asserts the existence of absolute space and accordingly distinguishes absolutefrom relative motion in the copernican controversy both sides were committed to this view since they thought there was a difference between sayingthe heavens revolve from east to west and saying the earth rotates from west to east if allmotion is relative these two statements are merely different ways of saying the same thing like john is the father of james and james is the son of john but if all motion is relative andspace is not substantial we are left with the parmenidean arguments against the void on ourhands descartes whose arguments are of just the same sort as those of early greek philosophers saidthat extension is the essence of matter and therefore there is matter everywhere for himextension is an adjective not a substantive its substantive is matter and without its substantive itcannot exist empty space to him is as absurd as happiness without a sentient being who ishappy leibniz on somewhat different grounds also believed in the plenum but he maintainedthat space is merely a system of relations on this subject there was a famous controversy betweenhim and newton the latter represented by clarke the controversy remained undecided until thetime of einstein whose theory conclusively gave the victory to leibniz the modern physicist while he still believes that matter is in some sense atomic does not believein empty space where there is not matter there is still something notably lightwaves matter nolonger has the lofty status that it acquired in philosophy through the arguments of parmenides it isnot unchanging substance but merely a way of grouping events some events belong to groupsthat can be regarded as material things others such as lightwaves do not it is the events that arethe stuff of the world and each of them is of brief duration in this respect modern physics is onthe side of heraclitus as against parmenides but it was on the side of parmenides until einsteinand quantum theory as regards space the modern view is that it is neither a substance as newton maintained and as leucippus and democritus ought to have said nor an adjective of extended bodies as descartesthought but a system of relations as leibniz held it is not by any means clear whether this view iscompatible with the existence of the void perhaps as a matter of abstract logic it can bereconciled with the void we might say that between any two things there is a certain greateror smaller distance and that distance does not imply the existence of intermediate things sucha point of view however would be impossible to utilize in modern physics since einsteindistance is between events not between things and involves time as well as space it isessentially a causal conception and in modern physics there is no action at a distance all thishowever is based upon empirical rather than logical grounds moreover the modern viewcannot be stated except in terms of differential equations and would therefore be unintelligibleto the philosophers of antiquity it would seem accordingly that the logical development of the views of the atomists is the newtonian theory of absolute space which meets the difficulty of attributing reality to notbeing to this theory there are no logical objections the chief objection is that absolute spaceis absolutely unknowable and cannot therefore be a necessary hypothesis in an empiricalscience the more practical objection is that physics can get on without it but the world of theatomists remains logically possible and is more akin to the actual world than is the world ofany other of the ancient philosophers democritus worked out his theories in considerable detail and some of the working out isinteresting each atom he said was impenetrable and indivisible because it contained no void when you use a knife to cut an apple the knife has to find empty places where it can penetrateif the apple contained no void it would be infinitely hard and therefore physically indivisible each atom is internally unchanging and in fact a parmenidean one the only things that atomsdo are to move and hit each other and sometimes to combine when they happen to have shapesthat are capable of interlocking they are of all sorts of shapes fire is composed of smallspherical atoms and so is the soul atoms by collision produce vortices which generatebodies and ultimately worlds there are many worlds some growing some decaying somemay have no sun or moon some several every world has a beginning and an end a world maybe  on the way in which this was supposed to happen see bailey op cit p ff

chapter xxx john dewey john dewey who was born in is generally admitted to be the leading living philosopherof america in this estimate i entirely concur he has had a profound influence not only amongphilosophers but on students of education aesthetics and political theory he is a man of thehighest character liberal in outlook generous and kind in personal relations indefatigable inwork with most of his opinions i am in almost complete agreement owing to my respect andadmiration for him as well as to personal experience of his kindness i should wish to agreecompletely but to my regret i am compelled to dissent from his most distinctive philosophicaldoctrine namely the substitution of inquiry for truth as the fundamental concept of logic andtheory of knowledge like william james dewey is a new englander and carries on the tradition of new englandliberalism which has been abandoned by some of the descendants of the great new englanders ofa hundred years ago he has never been what might be called a mere philosopher educationespecially has been in the forefront of his interests and his influence on american education hasbeen profound i in my lesser way have tried to have an influence on education very similar tohis perhaps he like me has not always been satisfied with the practice of those who professed tofollow his teaching but any new doctrine in practice is bound to be subject to some extravaganceand excess this however does not matter so much as might be thought because the faults ofwhat is new are so much more easily seen than those of what is traditional when dewey became professor of philosophy at chicago in pedagogy was included amonghis subjects he founded a progressive school and wrote much about education what he wrote atthis time was summed up in his book the school and society which is considered the most influential of all his writings he has continued to write on educationthroughout his life almost as much as on philosophy other social and political questions have also had a large share of his thought like myself he wasmuch influenced by visits to russia and china negatively in the first case positively in thesecond he was reluctantly a supporter of the first world war he had an important part in theinquiry as to trotskys alleged guilt and while he was convinced that the charges wereunfounded he did not think that the soviet regime would have been satisfactory if trotsky insteadof stalin had been lenins successor he became persuaded that violent revolution leading todictatorship is not the way to achieve a good society although very liberal in all economicquestions he has never been a marxist i heard him say once that having emancipated himselfwith some difficulty from the traditional orthodox theology he was not going to shackle himselfwith another in all this his point of view is almost identical with my own from the strictly philosophic point of view the chief importance of deweys work lies in hiscriticism of the traditional notion of truth which is embodied in the theory that he callsinstrumentalism truth as conceived by most professional philosophers is static and finalperfect and eternal in religious terminology it may be identified with gods thoughts and withthose thoughts which as rational beings we share with god the perfect model of truth is themultiplication table which is precise and certain and free from all temporal dross since pythagoras and still more since plato mathematics has been linked with theology and hasprofoundly influenced the theory of knowledge of most professional philosophers deweysinterests are biological rather than mathematical and he conceives thought as an evolutionaryprocess the traditional view would of course admit that men gradually come to know more buteach piece of knowledge when achieved is regarded as something final hegel it is true does notregard human knowledge in this way he conceives human knowledge as an organic wholegradually growing in every part and not perfect in any part until the whole is perfect but althoughthe hegelian philosophy influenced dewey in his youth it still has its absolute and its eternalworld which is more real than the temporal process these can have no place in deweys thoughtfor 
considered the most influential of all his writings he has continued to write on educationthroughout his life almost as much as on philosophy other social and political questions have also had a large share of his thought like myself he wasmuch influenced by visits to russia and china negatively in the first case positively in thesecond he was reluctantly a supporter of the first world war he had an important part in theinquiry as to trotskys alleged guilt and while he was convinced that the charges wereunfounded he did not think that the soviet regime would have been satisfactory if trotsky insteadof stalin had been lenins successor he became persuaded that violent revolution leading todictatorship is not the way to achieve a good society although very liberal in all economicquestions he has never been a marxist i heard him say once that having emancipated himselfwith some difficulty from the traditional orthodox theology he was not going to shackle himselfwith another in all this his point of view is almost identical with my own from the strictly philosophic point of view the chief importance of deweys work lies in hiscriticism of the traditional notion of truth which is embodied in the theory that he callsinstrumentalism truth as conceived by most professional philosophers is static and finalperfect and eternal in religious terminology it may be identified with gods thoughts and withthose thoughts which as rational beings we share with god the perfect model of truth is themultiplication table which is precise and certain and free from all temporal dross since pythagoras and still more since plato mathematics has been linked with theology and hasprofoundly influenced the theory of knowledge of most professional philosophers deweysinterests are biological rather than mathematical and he conceives thought as an evolutionaryprocess the traditional view would of course admit that men gradually come to know more buteach piece of knowledge when achieved is regarded as something final hegel it is true does notregard human knowledge in this way he conceives human knowledge as an organic wholegradually growing in every part and not perfect in any part until the whole is perfect but althoughthe hegelian philosophy influenced dewey in his youth it still has its absolute and its eternalworld which is more real than the temporal process these can have no place in deweys thoughtfor which all reality is temporal and process though evolutionary is not as for hegel the unfoldingof an eternal idea so far i am in agreement with dewey nor is this the end of my agreement before embarkingupon discussion of the points as to which i differ i will say a few words as to my own view oftruth the first question is what sort of thing is true or false the simplest answer would be asentence columbus crossed the ocean in is true columbus crossed the ocean in isfalse this answer is correct but incomplete sentences are true or false as the case may bebecause they are significant and their significance depends upon the language used if you weretranslating an account of columbus into arabic you would have to alter into thecorresponding year of the mohammedan era sentences in different languages may have the samesignificance and it is the significance not the words that determines whether the sentence istrue or false when you assert a sentence you express a belief which may be equally wellexpressed in a different language the belief whatever it may be is what is true or false ormore or less true thus we are driven to the investigation of belief now a belief provided it is sufficiently simple may exist without being expressed in words itwould be difficult without using words to believe that the ratio of the circumference of a circle tothe diameter is approximately or that caesar when he decided to cross the rubiconsealed the fate of the roman republican constitution but in simple cases unverbalized beliefs arecommon suppose for instance in descending a staircase you make a mistake as to when youhave got to the bottom you take a step suitable for level ground and come down with a bump the result is a violent shock of surprise you would naturally say i thought i was at the bottombut in fact you were not thinking about the stairs or you would not have made the mistake yourmuscles were adjusted in a way suitable to the bottom when in fact you were not yet there it wasyour body rather than your mind that made the mistakeat least that would be a natural way toexpress what happened but in fact the distinction between mind and body is a dubious one it willbe better to speak of an organism leaving the division of its activities between the mind and thebody undetermined one can say then your organism was adjusted in a manner which wouldhave been 
which all reality is temporal and process though evolutionary is not as for hegel the unfoldingof an eternal idea so far i am in agreement with dewey nor is this the end of my agreement before embarkingupon discussion of the points as to which i differ i will say a few words as to my own view oftruth the first question is what sort of thing is true or false the simplest answer would be asentence columbus crossed the ocean in is true columbus crossed the ocean in isfalse this answer is correct but incomplete sentences are true or false as the case may bebecause they are significant and their significance depends upon the language used if you weretranslating an account of columbus into arabic you would have to alter into thecorresponding year of the mohammedan era sentences in different languages may have the samesignificance and it is the significance not the words that determines whether the sentence istrue or false when you assert a sentence you express a belief which may be equally wellexpressed in a different language the belief whatever it may be is what is true or false ormore or less true thus we are driven to the investigation of belief now a belief provided it is sufficiently simple may exist without being expressed in words itwould be difficult without using words to believe that the ratio of the circumference of a circle tothe diameter is approximately or that caesar when he decided to cross the rubiconsealed the fate of the roman republican constitution but in simple cases unverbalized beliefs arecommon suppose for instance in descending a staircase you make a mistake as to when youhave got to the bottom you take a step suitable for level ground and come down with a bump the result is a violent shock of surprise you would naturally say i thought i was at the bottombut in fact you were not thinking about the stairs or you would not have made the mistake yourmuscles were adjusted in a way suitable to the bottom when in fact you were not yet there it wasyour body rather than your mind that made the mistakeat least that would be a natural way toexpress what happened but in fact the distinction between mind and body is a dubious one it willbe better to speak of an organism leaving the division of its activities between the mind and thebody undetermined one can say then your organism was adjusted in a manner which wouldhave been suitable if you had been at the bottom but in fact was not suitable this failure of adjustmentconstituted error and one may say that you were entertaining a false belief the test of error in the above illustration is surprise i think this is true generally of beliefs thatcan be tested a false belief is one which in suitable circumstances will cause the personentertaining it to experience surprise while a true belief will not have this effect but althoughsurprise is a good criterion when it is applicable it does not give the meaning of the words trueand false and is not always applicable suppose you are walking in a thunderstorm and you sayto yourself i am not at all likely to be struck by lightning the next moment you are struck butyou experience no surprise because you are dead if one day the sun explodes as sir james jeansseems to expect we shall all perish instantly and therefore not be surprised but unless we expectthe catastrophe we shall all have been mistaken such illustrations suggest objectivity in truth andfalsehood what is true is a state of the organism but it is true in general invirtue of occurrences outside the organism sometimes experimental tests are possible todetermine truth and falsehood but sometimes they are not when they are not the alternativenevertheless remains and is significant i will not further develop my view of truth and falsehood but will proceed to the examination of deweys doctrine dewey does not aim at judgements that shall be absolutely true or condemn theircontradictories as absolutely false in his opinion there is a process called inquiry which isone form of mutual adjustment between an organism and its environment if i wished from mypoint of view to go as far as possible towards agreeing with dewey i should begin by an analysisof meaning or significance suppose for example you are at the zoo and you hear a voicethrough a megaphone saying a lion has just escaped you will in that case act as you would ifyou saw the lionthat is to say you will get away as quickly as possible the sentence a lion hasescaped means a certain occurrence in the sense that it promotes the same behaviour as theoccurrence would if you saw it broadly a sentence s means an event e if it promotes behaviourwhich e would have promoted if there has in fact been no such occurrence the sentence is false just the same applies to a belief which is not expressed in words one may 
suitable if you had been at the bottom but in fact was not suitable this failure of adjustmentconstituted error and one may say that you were entertaining a false belief the test of error in the above illustration is surprise i think this is true generally of beliefs thatcan be tested a false belief is one which in suitable circumstances will cause the personentertaining it to experience surprise while a true belief will not have this effect but althoughsurprise is a good criterion when it is applicable it does not give the meaning of the words trueand false and is not always applicable suppose you are walking in a thunderstorm and you sayto yourself i am not at all likely to be struck by lightning the next moment you are struck butyou experience no surprise because you are dead if one day the sun explodes as sir james jeansseems to expect we shall all perish instantly and therefore not be surprised but unless we expectthe catastrophe we shall all have been mistaken such illustrations suggest objectivity in truth andfalsehood what is true is a state of the organism but it is true in general invirtue of occurrences outside the organism sometimes experimental tests are possible todetermine truth and falsehood but sometimes they are not when they are not the alternativenevertheless remains and is significant i will not further develop my view of truth and falsehood but will proceed to the examination of deweys doctrine dewey does not aim at judgements that shall be absolutely true or condemn theircontradictories as absolutely false in his opinion there is a process called inquiry which isone form of mutual adjustment between an organism and its environment if i wished from mypoint of view to go as far as possible towards agreeing with dewey i should begin by an analysisof meaning or significance suppose for example you are at the zoo and you hear a voicethrough a megaphone saying a lion has just escaped you will in that case act as you would ifyou saw the lionthat is to say you will get away as quickly as possible the sentence a lion hasescaped means a certain occurrence in the sense that it promotes the same behaviour as theoccurrence would if you saw it broadly a sentence s means an event e if it promotes behaviourwhich e would have promoted if there has in fact been no such occurrence the sentence is false just the same applies to a belief which is not expressed in words one may say a belief is a state of an organism promoting behaviour such as a certain occurrence wouldpromote if sensibly present the occurrence which would promote this behaviour is thesignificance of the belief this statement is unduly simplified but it may serve to indicate thetheory i am advocating so far i do not think that dewey and i would disagree very much butwith his further developments i find myself in very definite disagreement dewey makes inquiry the essence of logic not truth or knowledge he defines inquiry as followsinquiry is the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that isso determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert the elements of theoriginal situation into a unified whole he adds that inquiry is concerned with objectivetransformations of objective subjectmatter this definition is plainly inadequate take forinstance the dealings of a drillsergeant with a crowd of recruits or of a bricklayer with a heap ofbricks these exactly fulfil deweys definition of inquiry since he clearly would not includethem there must be an element in his notion of inquiry which he has forgotten to mention in hisdefinition what this element is i shall attempt to determine in a moment but let us first considerwhat emerges from the definition as it stands it is clear that inquiry as conceived by dewey is part of the general process of attempting tomake the world more organic unified wholes are to be the outcome of inquiries deweys loveof what is organic is due partly to biology partly to the lingering influence of hegel unless on thebasis of an unconscious hegelian metaphysic i do not see why inquiry should be expected toresult in unified wholes if i am given a pack of cards in disorder and asked to inquire into theirsequence i shall if i follow deweys prescription first arrange them in order and then say thatthis was the order resulting from inquiry there will be it is true an objective transformation ofobjective subjectmatter while i am arranging the cards but the definition allows for this if atthe end i am told we wanted to know the sequence of the cards when they were given to younot after you had rearranged them i shall if i am a disciple of dewey reply your ideas arealtogether too static i am a dynamic person and when i inquire into any subjectmatter i first alterit in such a way as to make the inquiry easy the notion that such a procedure 
say a belief is a state of an organism promoting behaviour such as a certain occurrence wouldpromote if sensibly present the occurrence which would promote this behaviour is thesignificance of the belief this statement is unduly simplified but it may serve to indicate thetheory i am advocating so far i do not think that dewey and i would disagree very much butwith his further developments i find myself in very definite disagreement dewey makes inquiry the essence of logic not truth or knowledge he defines inquiry as followsinquiry is the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that isso determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert the elements of theoriginal situation into a unified whole he adds that inquiry is concerned with objectivetransformations of objective subjectmatter this definition is plainly inadequate take forinstance the dealings of a drillsergeant with a crowd of recruits or of a bricklayer with a heap ofbricks these exactly fulfil deweys definition of inquiry since he clearly would not includethem there must be an element in his notion of inquiry which he has forgotten to mention in hisdefinition what this element is i shall attempt to determine in a moment but let us first considerwhat emerges from the definition as it stands it is clear that inquiry as conceived by dewey is part of the general process of attempting tomake the world more organic unified wholes are to be the outcome of inquiries deweys loveof what is organic is due partly to biology partly to the lingering influence of hegel unless on thebasis of an unconscious hegelian metaphysic i do not see why inquiry should be expected toresult in unified wholes if i am given a pack of cards in disorder and asked to inquire into theirsequence i shall if i follow deweys prescription first arrange them in order and then say thatthis was the order resulting from inquiry there will be it is true an objective transformation ofobjective subjectmatter while i am arranging the cards but the definition allows for this if atthe end i am told we wanted to know the sequence of the cards when they were given to younot after you had rearranged them i shall if i am a disciple of dewey reply your ideas arealtogether too static i am a dynamic person and when i inquire into any subjectmatter i first alterit in such a way as to make the inquiry easy the notion that such a procedure is legitimate can only be justified by a hegelian distinction of appearance and reality theappearance may be confused and fragmentary but the reality is always orderly and organic therefore when i arrange the cards i am only revealing their true eternal nature but this part ofthe doctrine is never made explicit the metaphysic of organism underlies deweys theories but ido not know how far he is aware of this fact let us now try to find the supplement to deweys definition which is required in order todistinguish inquiry from other kinds of organizing activity such as those of the drillsergeant andthe bricklayer formerly it would have been said that inquiry is distinguished by its purposewhich is to ascertain some truth but for dewey truth is to be defined in terms of inquiry notvice versa he quotes with approval peirces definition truth is the opinion which is fated to beultimately agreed to by all who investigate this leaves us completely in the dark as to what theinvestigators are doing for we cannot without circularity say that they are endeavoring toascertain the truth i think dr deweys theory might be stated as follows the relations of an organism to itsenvironment are sometimes satisfactory to the organism sometimes unsatisfactory when they areunsatisfactory the situation may be improved by mutual adjustment when the alterations bymeans of which the situation is improved are mainly on the side of the organismthey are neverwholly on either sidethe process involved is called inquiry for example during a battle you aremainly concerned to alter the environment ie the enemy but during the preceding period ofreconnaissance you are mainly concerned to adapt your own forces to his dispositions this earlierperiod is one of inquiry the difficulty of this theory to my mind lies in the severing of the relation between a belief andthe fact or facts which would commonly be said to verify it let us continue to consider theexample of a general planning a battle his reconnaissance planes report to him certain enemypreparations and he in consequence makes certain counterpreparations common sense wouldsay that the reports upon which he acts are true if in fact the enemy have made the moveswhich they are said to have made and that in that case the reports remain true even if the generalsubsequently loses the battle this view 
is legitimate can only be justified by a hegelian distinction of appearance and reality theappearance may be confused and fragmentary but the reality is always orderly and organic therefore when i arrange the cards i am only revealing their true eternal nature but this part ofthe doctrine is never made explicit the metaphysic of organism underlies deweys theories but ido not know how far he is aware of this fact let us now try to find the supplement to deweys definition which is required in order todistinguish inquiry from other kinds of organizing activity such as those of the drillsergeant andthe bricklayer formerly it would have been said that inquiry is distinguished by its purposewhich is to ascertain some truth but for dewey truth is to be defined in terms of inquiry notvice versa he quotes with approval peirces definition truth is the opinion which is fated to beultimately agreed to by all who investigate this leaves us completely in the dark as to what theinvestigators are doing for we cannot without circularity say that they are endeavoring toascertain the truth i think dr deweys theory might be stated as follows the relations of an organism to itsenvironment are sometimes satisfactory to the organism sometimes unsatisfactory when they areunsatisfactory the situation may be improved by mutual adjustment when the alterations bymeans of which the situation is improved are mainly on the side of the organismthey are neverwholly on either sidethe process involved is called inquiry for example during a battle you aremainly concerned to alter the environment ie the enemy but during the preceding period ofreconnaissance you are mainly concerned to adapt your own forces to his dispositions this earlierperiod is one of inquiry the difficulty of this theory to my mind lies in the severing of the relation between a belief andthe fact or facts which would commonly be said to verify it let us continue to consider theexample of a general planning a battle his reconnaissance planes report to him certain enemypreparations and he in consequence makes certain counterpreparations common sense wouldsay that the reports upon which he acts are true if in fact the enemy have made the moveswhich they are said to have made and that in that case the reports remain true even if the generalsubsequently loses the battle this view is rejected by dr dewey he does not divide beliefs into true and false but he still has twokinds of beliefs which we will call satisfactory if the general wins and unsatisfactory if he isdefeated until the battle has taken place he cannot tell what to think about the reports of hisscouts generalizing we may say that dr dewey like everyone else divides beliefs into two classes ofwhich one is good and the other bad he holds however that a belief may be good at one timeand bad at another this happens with imperfect theories which are better than their predecessorsbut worse than their successors whether a belief is good or bad depends upon whether theactivities which it inspires in the organism entertaining the belief have consequences which aresatisfactory or unsatisfactory to it thus a belief about some event in the past is to be classified asgood or bad not according to whether the event really took place but according to the futureeffects of the belief the results are curious suppose somebody says to me did you have coffeewith your breakfast this morning if i am an ordinary person i shall try to remember but if i ama disciple of dr dewey i shall say wait a while i must try two experiments before i can tellyou i shall then first make myself believe that i had coffee and observe the consequences if any i shall then make myself believe that i did not have coffee and again observe the consequences ifany i shall then compare the two sets of consequences to see which i found the more satisfactory if there is a balance on one side i shall decide for that answer if there is not i shall have toconfess that i cannot answer the question but this is not the end of our troubles how am i to know the consequences of believing that i hadcoffee for breakfast if i say the consequences are suchandsuch this in turn will have to betested by its consequences before i can know whether what i have said was a good or a badstatement and even if this difficulty were overcome how am i to judge which set ofconsequences is the more satisfactory one decision as to whether i had coffee may fill me withcontentment the other with determination to further the war effort each of these may beconsidered good but until i have decided which is better i cannot tell whether i had coffee forbreakfast surely this is absurd deweys divergence from what has hitherto been regarded as com 
is rejected by dr dewey he does not divide beliefs into true and false but he still has twokinds of beliefs which we will call satisfactory if the general wins and unsatisfactory if he isdefeated until the battle has taken place he cannot tell what to think about the reports of hisscouts generalizing we may say that dr dewey like everyone else divides beliefs into two classes ofwhich one is good and the other bad he holds however that a belief may be good at one timeand bad at another this happens with imperfect theories which are better than their predecessorsbut worse than their successors whether a belief is good or bad depends upon whether theactivities which it inspires in the organism entertaining the belief have consequences which aresatisfactory or unsatisfactory to it thus a belief about some event in the past is to be classified asgood or bad not according to whether the event really took place but according to the futureeffects of the belief the results are curious suppose somebody says to me did you have coffeewith your breakfast this morning if i am an ordinary person i shall try to remember but if i ama disciple of dr dewey i shall say wait a while i must try two experiments before i can tellyou i shall then first make myself believe that i had coffee and observe the consequences if any i shall then make myself believe that i did not have coffee and again observe the consequences ifany i shall then compare the two sets of consequences to see which i found the more satisfactory if there is a balance on one side i shall decide for that answer if there is not i shall have toconfess that i cannot answer the question but this is not the end of our troubles how am i to know the consequences of believing that i hadcoffee for breakfast if i say the consequences are suchandsuch this in turn will have to betested by its consequences before i can know whether what i have said was a good or a badstatement and even if this difficulty were overcome how am i to judge which set ofconsequences is the more satisfactory one decision as to whether i had coffee may fill me withcontentment the other with determination to further the war effort each of these may beconsidered good but until i have decided which is better i cannot tell whether i had coffee forbreakfast surely this is absurd deweys divergence from what has hitherto been regarded as com mon sense is due to his refusal to admit facts into his metaphysic in the sense in which factsare stubborn and cannot be manipulated in this it may be that common sense is changing and thathis view will not seem contrary to what common sense is becoming the main difference between dr dewey and me is that he judges a belief by its effects whereas ijudge it by its causes where a past occurrence is concerned i consider such a belief true or asnearly true as we can make it if it has a certain kind of relation toits causes dr dewey holds that it has warranted assertabilitywhich he substitutes for truthif it has certain kinds of effects this divergence is connected with a difference of outlook on theworld the past cannot be affected by what we do and therefore if truth is determined by whathas happened it is independent of present or future volitions it represents in logical form thelimitations on human power but if truth or rather warranted assertability depends upon thefuture then in so far as it is in our power to alter the future it is in our power to alter what shouldbe asserted this enlarges the sense of human power and freedom did caesar cross the rubicon i should regard an affirmative answer as unalterably necessitated by a past event dr deweywould decide whether to say yes or no by an appraisal of future events and there is no reason whythese future events could not be arranged by human power so as to make a negative answer themore satisfactory if i find the belief that caesar crossed the rubicon very distasteful i need notsit down in dull despair i can if i have enough skill and power arrange a social environment inwhich the statement that he did not cross the rubicon will have warranted assertability throughout this book i have sought where possible to connect philosophies with the socialenvironment of the philosophers concerned it has seemed to me that the belief in human powerand the unwillingness to admit stubborn facts were connected with the hopefulness engenderedby machine production and the scientific manipulation of our physical environment this view isshared by many of dr deweys supporters thus george raymond geiger in a laudatory essaysays that dr deweys method would mean a revolution in thought just as middleclass andunspectacular but just as stupendous as the revolution in industry of a century ago it seemed tome that i was saying the same thing when i wrote dr 
mon sense is due to his refusal to admit facts into his metaphysic in the sense in which factsare stubborn and cannot be manipulated in this it may be that common sense is changing and thathis view will not seem contrary to what common sense is becoming the main difference between dr dewey and me is that he judges a belief by its effects whereas ijudge it by its causes where a past occurrence is concerned i consider such a belief true or asnearly true as we can make it if it has a certain kind of relation toits causes dr dewey holds that it has warranted assertabilitywhich he substitutes for truthif it has certain kinds of effects this divergence is connected with a difference of outlook on theworld the past cannot be affected by what we do and therefore if truth is determined by whathas happened it is independent of present or future volitions it represents in logical form thelimitations on human power but if truth or rather warranted assertability depends upon thefuture then in so far as it is in our power to alter the future it is in our power to alter what shouldbe asserted this enlarges the sense of human power and freedom did caesar cross the rubicon i should regard an affirmative answer as unalterably necessitated by a past event dr deweywould decide whether to say yes or no by an appraisal of future events and there is no reason whythese future events could not be arranged by human power so as to make a negative answer themore satisfactory if i find the belief that caesar crossed the rubicon very distasteful i need notsit down in dull despair i can if i have enough skill and power arrange a social environment inwhich the statement that he did not cross the rubicon will have warranted assertability throughout this book i have sought where possible to connect philosophies with the socialenvironment of the philosophers concerned it has seemed to me that the belief in human powerand the unwillingness to admit stubborn facts were connected with the hopefulness engenderedby machine production and the scientific manipulation of our physical environment this view isshared by many of dr deweys supporters thus george raymond geiger in a laudatory essaysays that dr deweys method would mean a revolution in thought just as middleclass andunspectacular but just as stupendous as the revolution in industry of a century ago it seemed tome that i was saying the same thing when i wrote dr dewey has an outlook which where it is distinctive is in harmony with the age of industrialismand collective enterprise it is natural that his strongest appeal should be to americans and alsothat he should be almost equally appreciated by the progressive elements in countries like chinaand mexico to my regret and surprise this statement which i had supposed completely innocuous vexed dr dewey who replied mr russells confirmed habit of connecting the pragmatic theory ofknowing with obnoxious aspects of american industrialism  is much as if i were to link hisphilosophy to the interests of the english landed aristocracy for my part i am accustomed to having my opinions explained asdue to my connection with the british aristocracy and i am quite willing to suppose that myviews like other mens are influenced by social environment but if in regard to dr dewey i ammistaken as to the social influences concerned i regret the mistake i find however that i am notalone in having made it santayana for instance says in dewey as in current science and ethicsthere is a pervasive quasi hegelian tendency to dissolve the individual into his social functions aswell as everything substantial and actual into something relative and transitional dr deweys world it seems to me is one in which human beings occupy the imagination thecosmos of astronomy though of course acknowledged to exist is at most times ignored hisphilosophy is a power philosophy though not like nietzsches a philosophy of individual powerit is the power of the community that is felt to be valuable it is this element of social power thatseems to me to make the philosophy of instrumentalism attractive to those who are moreimpressed by our new control over natural forces than by the limitations to which that control isstill subject the attitude of man towards the nonhuman environment has differed profoundly at differenttimes the greeks with their dread of hubris and their belief in a necessity or fate superior evento zeus carefully avoided what would have seemed to them insolence towards the universe the middle ages carried submission much further humility towards god was a christians first duty initiative was cramped by this attitude and great originality was scarcely possible the renaissance restored human pride but carried it to the point 
dewey has an outlook which where it is distinctive is in harmony with the age of industrialismand collective enterprise it is natural that his strongest appeal should be to americans and alsothat he should be almost equally appreciated by the progressive elements in countries like chinaand mexico to my regret and surprise this statement which i had supposed completely innocuous vexed dr dewey who replied mr russells confirmed habit of connecting the pragmatic theory ofknowing with obnoxious aspects of american industrialism  is much as if i were to link hisphilosophy to the interests of the english landed aristocracy for my part i am accustomed to having my opinions explained asdue to my connection with the british aristocracy and i am quite willing to suppose that myviews like other mens are influenced by social environment but if in regard to dr dewey i ammistaken as to the social influences concerned i regret the mistake i find however that i am notalone in having made it santayana for instance says in dewey as in current science and ethicsthere is a pervasive quasi hegelian tendency to dissolve the individual into his social functions aswell as everything substantial and actual into something relative and transitional dr deweys world it seems to me is one in which human beings occupy the imagination thecosmos of astronomy though of course acknowledged to exist is at most times ignored hisphilosophy is a power philosophy though not like nietzsches a philosophy of individual powerit is the power of the community that is felt to be valuable it is this element of social power thatseems to me to make the philosophy of instrumentalism attractive to those who are moreimpressed by our new control over natural forces than by the limitations to which that control isstill subject the attitude of man towards the nonhuman environment has differed profoundly at differenttimes the greeks with their dread of hubris and their belief in a necessity or fate superior evento zeus carefully avoided what would have seemed to them insolence towards the universe the middle ages carried submission much further humility towards god was a christians first duty initiative

undone by the reformation and the counterreformation but modern technique while not altogether favourable to the lordlyindividual of the renaissance has revived the sense of the collective power of

but a system of relations as leibniz held it is not by any means clear whether this view iscompatible with the existence of the void perhaps as a matter of abstract logic it can bereconciled with the void we might say that between any two things there is a certain greateror smaller distance and that distance does not imply the existence of intermediate things sucha point of view however would be impossible to utilize in modern physics since einsteindistance is between events not between things and involves time as well as space it isessentially a causal conception and in modern physics there is no action at a distance all thishowever is based upon empirical rather than logical grounds moreover the modern viewcannot be stated except in terms of differential equations and would therefore be unintelligibleto the philosophers of antiquity it would seem accordingly that the logical development of the views of the atomists is the newtonian theory of absolute space which meets the difficulty of attributing reality to notbeing to this theory there are no logical objections the chief objection is that absolute spaceis absolutely unknowable and cannot therefore be a necessary hypothesis in an empiricalscience the more practical objection is that physics can get on without it but the world of theatomists remains logically possible and is more akin to the actual world than is the world ofany other of the ancient philosophers democritus worked out his theories in considerable detail and some of the working out isinteresting each atom he said was impenetrable and indivisible because it contained no void when you use a knife to cut an apple the knife has to find empty places where it can penetrateif the apple contained no void it would be infinitely hard and therefore physically indivisible each atom is internally unchanging and in fact a parmenidean one the only things that atomsdo are to move and hit each other and sometimes to combine when they happen to have shapesthat are capable of interlocking they are of all sorts of shapes fire is composed of smallspherical atoms and so is the soul atoms by collision produce vortices which generatebodies and ultimately worlds there are many worlds some growing some decaying somemay have no sun or moon some several every world has a beginning and an end a world maybe  on the way in which this was supposed to happen see bailey op cit p ff destroyed by collision with a larger world this cosmology may be summarized in shelleyswords worlds on worlds are rolling ever from creation to decay like the bubbles on a river sparkling bursting borne away life developed out of the primeval slime there is some fire everywhere in a living body butmost in the brain or in the breast thought is a kind of motion andis thus able to cause motion elsewhere perception and thought are physical processes perception is of two sorts one of the senses one of the understanding perceptions of the lattersort depend only on the things perceived while those of the former sort depend also on oursenses and are therefore apt to be deceptive like locke democritus held that such qualities aswarmth taste and colour are not really in the object but are due to our senseorgans whilesuch qualities as weight density and hardness are really in the object democritus was a thoroughgoing materialist for him as we have seen the soul was composedof atoms and thought was a physical process there was no purpose in the universe there wereonly atoms governed by mechanical laws he disbelieved in popular religion and he arguedagainst the nous of anaxagoras in ethics he considered cheerfulness the goal of life andregarded moderation and culture as the best means to it he disliked everything violent andpassionate he disapproved of sex because he said it involved the overwhelming ofconsciousness by pleasure he valued friendship but thought ill of women and did not desirechildren because their education interferes with philosophy in all this he was very like jeremy bentham he was equally so in his love of what the greeks called democracy democritussuch at least is my opinionis the last of the greek philosophers to be free from acertain fault which vitiated all later ancient and medieval thought all the philosophers we havebeen considering so far were engaged in a disinterested effort to understand the world theythought it easier to understand than it is but without this optimism they would not have had thecourage to make a  poverty in a democracy is as much to be preferred to what is called prosperity underdespots as freedom is to slavery he says

infinite collection as one which has parts containing as many terms asthe whole collection contains on this basis he was able to build up a most interestingmathematical theory of infinite numbers thereby taking into the realm of exact logic a wholeregion formerly given over to mysticism and confusion the next man of importance was frege who published his first work in and his definitionof number in but in spite of the epochmaking nature of his discoveries he remainedwholly without recognition until i drew attention to him in it is remarkable that before frege every definition of number that had been suggested contained elementary logical blunders it was customary to identify number with plurality but an instance of number is a particularnumber say and an instance of is a particular triad the triad is a plurality but the class of alltriadswhich frege identified with the number is a plurality of pluralities and number ingeneral of which is an instance is a plurality of pluralities of pluralities the elementarygrammatical mistake of confounding this with the simple plurality of a given triad made the wholephilosophy of number before frege a tissue of nonsense in the strictest sense of the termnonsense from freges work it followed that arithmetic and pure mathematics generally is nothing but aprolongation of deductive logic this disproved kants theory that arithmetical propositions aresynthetic and involve a reference to time the development of pure mathematics from logic wasset forth in detail in principia mathematica by whitehead and myself it gradually became clear that a great part of philosophy can be reduced to something that may becalled syntax though the word has to be used in a somewhat wider sense than has hitherto beencustomary some men notably carnap have advanced the theory that all philosophical problemsare really syntactical and that when errors in syntax are avoided a philosophical problem isthereby either solved or shown to be

sun but although the sun of our visual experience is very different from the sun of theastronomer it is still a source of knowledge as to the latter because seeing the sun differs fromseeing the moon in ways that are causally connected with the difference between theastronomers sun and the astronomers moon what we can know of physical objects in this wayhowever is only certain abstract properties of structure we can know that the sun is round in asense though not quite the sense in which what we see is round but we have no reason to supposethat it is bright or warm because physics can account for its seeming so without supposing that itis so our knowledge of the physical world therefore is only abstract and mathematical modern analytical empiricism of which i have been giving an outline differs from that of locke berkeley and hume by its incorporation of mathematics and its development of a powerfullogical technique it is thus able in regard to certain problems to achieve definite answers whichhave the quality of science rather than of philosophy it has the advantage as compared with thephilosophies of the systembuilders of being able to tackle its problems one at a time instead ofhaving to invent at one stroke a block theory of the whole universe its methods in this respectresemble those of science i have no doubt that in so far as philosophical knowledge is possible itis by such methods that it must be sought i have also no doubt that by these methods manyancient problems are completely soluble there remains however a vast field traditionally included in philosophy where scientificmethods are inadequate this field includes ultimate questions of value science alone forexample cannot prove that it is bad to enjoy the infliction of cruelty whatever can be known canbe known by means of science but things which are legitimately matters of feeling lie outside itsprovince philosophy throughout its history has consisted of two parts inharmoniously blended on the onehand a theory as to the nature of the world on the other an ethical or political doctrine as to thebest way of living the failure to separate these two with sufficient clarity has been a source ofmuch confused thinking philosophers from plato to william james have allowed their opinionsas to the constitution of the universe to be influenced by the desire for edification knowing asthey supposed what beliefs would make men virtuous they have invented arguments often very sophistical to prove that these beliefs are true for mypart i reprobate this kind of bias both on moral and on intellectual grounds morally aphilosopher who uses his professional competence for anything except a disinterested search fortruth is guilty of a kind of treachery and when he assumes in advance of inquiry that certainbeliefs whether true or false are such as to promote good behaviour he is so limiting the scope ofphilosophical speculation as to make philosophy trivial the true philosopher is prepared toexamine all preconceptions when any limits are placed consciously or unconsciously upon thepursuit of truth philosophy becomes paralysed by fear and the ground is prepared for agovernment censorship punishing those who utter dangerous thoughtsin fact the philosopherhas already placed such a censorship over his own investigations intellectually the effect of mistaken moral considerations upon philosophy has been to impedeprogress to an extraordinary extent i do not myself believe that philosophy can either prove ordisprove the truth of religious dogmas but ever since plato most philosophers have considered itpart of their business to produce proofs of immortality and the existence of god they havefound fault with the proofs of their predecessorssaint thomas rejected saint anselms proofsand kant rejected descartesbut they have supplied new ones of their own in order to make theirproofs seem valid they have had to falsify logic to make mathematics mystical and to pretendthat deepseated prejudices were heavensent intuitions all this is rejected by the philosophers who make logical analysis the main business ofphilosophy they confess frankly that the human intellect is unable to find conclusive answers tomany questions of profound importance to mankind but they refuse to believe that there is somehigher way of knowing by which we can discover truths hidden from science and the intellect for this renunciation they have been rewarded by the discovery that many questions formerlyobscured by the fog of metaphysics can be answered with precision and by objective methodswhich introduce nothing of the philosophers temperament except the desire to understand takesuch questions as what is number what are space and time what is mind and what is matter ido not say that we can here and now give definitive answers to all these ancient questions but i dosay that a method has been discovered by which as in science we can make successive approximations tothe truth in which each new stage results from an improvement not a rejection of what has gonebefore in the welter of conflicting fanaticisms one of the few unifying forces is scientific truthfulness bywhich i mean the habit of basing our beliefs upon observations and inferences as impersonal andas much divested of local and temperamental bias as is possible for human beings to haveinsisted upon the introduction of this virtue into philosophy and to have invented a powerfulmethod by which it can be rendered fruitful are the chief merits of the philosophical school

ably largely hostility to the sophists that gave this character to his dialogues one of the defects ofall philosophers since plato is that their inquiries into ethics proceed on the assumption that theyalready know the conclusions to be reached it seems that there were men in the athens of the late fifth century who taught political doctrineswhich seemed immoral to their contemporaries and seem so to the democratic nations of thepresent day thrasymachus in the first book of the republic argues that there is no justice exceptthe interest of the stronger that laws are made by governments for their own advantage and thatthere is no impersonal standard to which to appeal in contests for power callicles according to plato maintained a similar doctrine the law of nature he said is the law of thestronger but for convenience men have established institutions and moral precepts to restrain thestrong such doctrines have won much wider assent in our day than they did in antiquity andwhatever may be thought of them they are not characteristic of the sophists during the fifth centurywhatever part the sophists may have had in the changethere was in athens a transformation from a certain stiff puritan simplicity to a quickwitted and rather cruelcynicism in conflict with a slowwitted and equally cruel defence of crumbling orthodoxy at thebeginning of the century comes the athenian championship of the cities of ionia against the persians and the victory of marathon in bc at the end comes the defeat of athens by spartain bc and the execution of socrates in bc after this time athens ceased to bepolitically important but acquired undoubted cultural supremacy which it retained until thevictory of christianity something of the history of fifthcentury athens is essential to the understanding of plato and ofall subsequent greek thought in the first persian war the chief glory went to the atheniansowing to the decisive victory at marathon in the second war ten years later the athenians stillwere the best of the greeks at sea but on land victory was mainly due to the spartans who werethe acknowledged leaders of the hellenic world the spartans however were narrowly provincialin their outlook and ceased to oppose the persians when they had been chased out of european greece the championship of the asiatic greeks and the liberation of the islands that had beencon quered by the persians was undertaken with great success by athens athens became the leadingsea power and acquired a considerable imperialist control over the ionian islands under theleadership of pericles who was a moderate democrat and a moderate imperialist athensprospered the great temples whose ruins are still the glory of athens were built by his initiativeto replace those destroyed by xerxes the city increased very rapidly in wealth and also inculture and as invariably happens at such times particularly when wealth is due to foreigncommerce traditional morality and traditional beliefs decayed there was at this time in athens an extraordinarily large number of men of genius the three greatdramatists aeschylus sophocles and euripides all belong to the fifth century aeschylus foughtat marathon and saw the battle of salamis sophocles was still religiously orthodox but euripideswas influenced by protagoras and by the freethinking spirit of the time and his treatment of themyths is sceptical and subversive aristophanes the comic poet made fun of socrates sophistsand philosophers but nevertheless belonged to their circle in the symposium plato represents himas on very friendly terms with socrates pheidias the sculptor as we have seen belonged to thecircle of pericles the excellence of athens at this period was artistic rather than intellectual none of the greatmathematicians or philosophers of the fifth century were athenians with the exception of socrates and socrates was not a writer but a man who confined himself to oral discussion the outbreak of the peloponnesian war in bc and the death of pericles in bcintroduced a darker period in athenian history the athenians were superior at sea but the spartans had supremacy on land and repeatedly occupied attica during thesummer the result was that athens was overcrowded and suffered severely from the plague in bc the athenians sent a large expedition to sicily in the hope of capturing syracuse whichwas allied with sparta but the attempt was a failure war made the athenians fierce andpersecuting in bc they conquered the island of melos put to death all men of military ageand enslaved the other inhabitants the trojan women of euripides is a protest against suchbarbarism the conflict had an ideological aspect since sparta was the champion of oligarchy and athens of democracy the athenians had reason to suspect someof their own aristocrats of treachery which was generally thought to have had a part in the finalnaval defeat at the battle of aegospotami in bc at the end of the war the spartans established in athens an oligarchial government known as the thirty tyrants some of the thirty including critias their chief had been pupils of socrates they were deservedly unpopular and were overthrown within a year with the compliance of sparta democracy was restored but it was an embittered democracy precluded by an amnestyfrom direct vengeance against its

part ii socrates plato and aristotle chapter xi socrates socrates is a very difficult subject for the historian there are many men concerning whom itis certain that very little is known and other men concerning whom it is certain that a great deal isknown but in the case of socrates the uncertainty is as to whether we know very little or a greatdeal he was undoubtedly an athenian citizen of moderate means who spent his time indisputation and taught philosophy to the young but not for money like the sophists he wascertainly tried condemned to death and executed in b c at about the age of seventy hewas unquestionably a wellknown figure in athens since aristophanes caricatured him in the clouds but beyond this point we become involved in controversy two of his pupils xenophonand plato wrote voluminously about him but they said very different things even when theyagree it has been suggested by burnet that xenophon is copying plato where they disagree somebelieve the one some the other some neither in such a dangerous dispute i shall not venture totake sides but i will set out briefly the various points of view let us begin with xenophon a military man not very liberally endowed with brains and on thewhole conventional in his outlook xenophon is pained that socrates should have been accused ofimpiety and of corrupting the youth he contends that on the contrary socrates was eminentlypious and had a thoroughly wholesome effect upon those who came under his influence hisideas it appears so far from being subversive were rather dull and commonplace this defence goes too far since itleaves the hostility to socrates unexplained as burnet says xenophons defence of socrates is too successful he would never have been put to death if hehad been like that there has been a tendency to think that everything xenophon says must be true because he hadnot the wits to think of anything untrue this is a very invalid line of argument a stupid mansreport of what a clever man says is never accurate because he unconsciously translates what hehears into something that he can understand i would rather be reported by my bitterest enemyamong philosophers than by a friend innocent of philosophy we cannot therefore accept what xenophon says if it either involves any difficult point in philosophy or is part of an argument toprove that socrates was unjustly condemned nevertheless some of xenophons reminiscences are very convincing he tells how socrates was continually occupied with the problem of getting competent men intopositions of power he would ask such questions as if i wanted a shoe mended whom should iemploy to which some ingenuous youth would answer a shoemaker o socrates he wouldgo on to carpenters coppersmiths etc and finally ask some such question as who should mendthe ship of state when he fell into conflict with the thirty tyrants critias their chief whoknew his ways from having studied under him forbade him to continue teaching the young andadded you had better be done with your shoemakers carpenters and coppersmiths these mustbe pretty well trodden out at heel by this time considering the circulation you have given them this happened during the brief oligarchic governmentestablished by the spartans at the end of the peloponnesian war but at most times athens wasdemocratic so much so that even generals were elected or chosen by lot socrates came across ayoung man who wished to become a general and persuaded him that it would be well to knowsomething of the art of war the young man accordingly went away and took a brief course intactics when he returned socrates after some satirical praise sent him back for furtherinstruction another young man he set to learning the principles of 
far from being subversive were rather dull and commonplace this defence goes too far since itleaves the hostility to socrates unexplained as burnet says xenophons defence of socrates is too successful he would never have been put to death if hehad been like that there has been a tendency to think that everything xenophon says must be true because he hadnot the wits to think of anything untrue this is a very invalid line of argument a stupid mansreport of what a clever man says is never accurate because he unconsciously translates what hehears into something that he can understand i would rather be reported by my bitterest enemyamong philosophers than by a friend innocent of philosophy we cannot therefore accept what xenophon says if it either involves any difficult point in philosophy or is part of an argument toprove that socrates was unjustly condemned nevertheless some of xenophons reminiscences are very convincing he tells how socrates was continually occupied with the problem of getting competent men intopositions of power he would ask such questions as if i wanted a shoe mended whom should iemploy to which some ingenuous youth would answer a shoemaker o socrates he wouldgo on to carpenters coppersmiths etc and finally ask some such question as who should mendthe ship of state when he fell into conflict with the thirty tyrants critias their chief whoknew his ways from having studied under him forbade him to continue teaching the young andadded you had better be done with your shoemakers carpenters and coppersmiths these mustbe pretty well trodden out at heel by this time considering the circulation you have given them this happened during the brief oligarchic governmentestablished by the spartans at the end of the peloponnesian war but at most times athens wasdemocratic so much so that even generals were elected or chosen by lot socrates came across ayoung man who wished to become a general and persuaded him that it would be well to knowsomething of the art of war the young man accordingly went away and took a brief course intactics when he returned socrates after some satirical praise sent him back for furtherinstruction another young man he set to learning the principles of finance he tried the same sort of plan on many people including the war minister but it wasdecided that it was easier to silence him by means of the hemlock than to cure the evils of whichhe complained with platos account of socrates the difficulty is quite a different one from what it is in the caseof xenophon namely that it is very hard to judge how far plato means to portray the historical socrates and how far he intends the person called socrates in his dialogues to be merely themouthpiece of his own opinions plato in addition to being a philosopher is an imaginative writerof great genius and charm no one supposes and he himself does not seriously pretend that theconversations in his dialogues took place just as he records them nevertheless at any rate in theearlier dialogues the conversation is completely natural and the characters quite convincing it isthe excellence of plato as a writer of fiction that throws doubt on him as a historian his socratesis a consistent and extraordinarily interesting character far beyond the power of most men toinvent but i think platocould have invented him whether he did so is of course another question the dialogue which is most generally regarded as historical is the apology this professes to bethe speech that socrates made in his own fence at his trialnot of course a stenographic reportbut what remained in platos memory some years after the event put together and elaborated withliterary art plato was present at the trial and it certainly seems fairly clear that what is set down isthe sort of thing that plato remembered socrates as saying and that the intention is broadlyspeaking historical this with all its limitations is enough to give a fairly definite picture of thecharacter of socrates the main facts of the trial of socrates are not open to doubt the prosecution was based upon thecharge that socrates is an evildoer and a curious person searching into things under the earthand above the heaven and making the worse appear the better cause and teaching all this toothers the real ground of hostility to him was almost certainly that he was supposed to beconnected with the aristocratic party most of his pupils belonged to this faction and some inpositions of power had proved themselves very pernicious but this ground could not be madeevident on account of the amnesty he was found guilty by a majority and it was then open tohim by 
finance he tried the same sort of plan on many people including the war minister but it wasdecided that it was easier to silence him by means of the hemlock than to cure the evils of whichhe complained with platos account of socrates the difficulty is quite a different one from what it is in the caseof xenophon namely that it is very hard to judge how far plato means to portray the historical socrates and how far he intends the person called socrates in his dialogues to be merely themouthpiece of his own opinions plato in addition to being a philosopher is an imaginative writerof great genius and charm no one supposes and he himself does not seriously pretend that theconversations in his dialogues took place just as he records them nevertheless at any rate in theearlier dialogues the conversation is completely natural and the characters quite convincing it isthe excellence of plato as a writer of fiction that throws doubt on him as a historian his socratesis a consistent and extraordinarily interesting character far beyond the power of most men toinvent but i think platocould have invented him whether he did so is of course another question the dialogue which is most generally regarded as historical is the apology this professes to bethe speech that socrates made in his own fence at his trialnot of course a stenographic reportbut what remained in platos memory some years after the event put together and elaborated withliterary art plato was present at the trial and it certainly seems fairly clear that what is set down isthe sort of thing that plato remembered socrates as saying and that the intention is broadlyspeaking historical this with all its limitations is enough to give a fairly definite picture of thecharacter of socrates the main facts of the trial of socrates are not open to doubt the prosecution was based upon thecharge that socrates is an evildoer and a curious person searching into things under the earthand above the heaven and making the worse appear the better cause and teaching all this toothers the real ground of hostility to him was almost certainly that he was supposed to beconnected with the aristocratic party most of his pupils belonged to this faction and some inpositions of power had proved themselves very pernicious but this ground could not be madeevident on account of the amnesty he was found guilty by a majority and it was then open tohim by athenian law to propose some lesser penalty than death the judges had to choose if they hadfound the accused guilty between the penalty demanded by the prosecution and that suggestedby the defence it was therefore to the interest of socrates to suggest a substantial penaltywhich the court might have accepted as adequate he however proposed a fine of thirty minaefor which some of his friends were willing to go surety this was so small apunishment that the court was annoyed and condemned him to death by a larger majority thanthat which had found him guilty undoubtedly he foresaw this result it is clear that he had nowish to avoid the death penalty by concessions which might seem to acknowledge his guilt the prosecutors were anytus a democratic politician meletus a tragic poet youthful andunknown with lanky hair and scanty beard and a hooked nose and lykon an obscurerhetorician they maintained that socrates was guilty ofnot worshipping the gods the state worshipped but introducing other new divinities and furtherthat he was guilty of corrupting the young by teaching them accordingly without further troubling ourselves with the insoluble question of the relation of the platonic socrates to the real man let us see what plato makes him say in answer to this charge socrates begins by accusing his prosecutors of eloquence and rebutting the charge of eloquenceas applied to himself the only eloquence of which he is capable he says is that of truth andthey must not be angry with him if he speaks in his accustomed manner not in a set orationduly ornamented with words and phrases he is over seventy and has never appeared in acourt of law until now they must therefore pardon his unforensic way of speaking he goes on to say that in addition to his formal accusers he has a large body of informalaccusers who ever since the judges were children have gone about telling of one socrates awise man who speculated about the heavens above and searched into the earth beneath andmade the worse appear the better cause such men he says are supposed not to believe in theexistence of the gods this old accusation by public opinion is more dangerous than the formal  in quotations from plato i have used jowetts translation 
athenian law to propose some lesser penalty than death the judges had to choose if they hadfound the accused guilty between the penalty demanded by the prosecution and that suggestedby the defence it was therefore to the interest of socrates to suggest a substantial penaltywhich the court might have accepted as adequate he however proposed a fine of thirty minaefor which some of his friends were willing to go surety this was so small apunishment that the court was annoyed and condemned him to death by a larger majority thanthat which had found him guilty undoubtedly he foresaw this result it is clear that he had nowish to avoid the death penalty by concessions which might seem to acknowledge his guilt the prosecutors were anytus a democratic politician meletus a tragic poet youthful andunknown with lanky hair and scanty beard and a hooked nose and lykon an obscurerhetorician they maintained that socrates was guilty ofnot worshipping the gods the state worshipped but introducing other new divinities and furtherthat he was guilty of corrupting the young by teaching them accordingly without further troubling ourselves with the insoluble question of the relation of the platonic socrates to the real man let us see what plato makes him say in answer to this charge socrates begins by accusing his prosecutors of eloquence and rebutting the charge of eloquenceas applied to himself the only eloquence of which he is capable he says is that of truth andthey must not be angry with him if he speaks in his accustomed manner not in a set orationduly ornamented with words and phrases he is over seventy and has never appeared in acourt of law until now they must therefore pardon his unforensic way of speaking he goes on to say that in addition to his formal accusers he has a large body of informalaccusers who ever since the judges were children have gone about telling of one socrates awise man who speculated about the heavens above and searched into the earth beneath andmade the worse appear the better cause such men he says are supposed not to believe in theexistence of the gods this old accusation by public opinion is more dangerous than the formal  in quotations from plato i have used jowetts translation indictment the more so as he does not know who are the men from whom it comes except inthe case of aristophanes he points out in reply to these older grounds of hostility that he isnot a man of sciencei have nothing to do with physical speculationsthat he is not a teacherand does not take money for teaching he goes on to make fun of the sophists and to disclaimthe knowledge that they profess to have what then is the reason why i am called wise andhave such an evil fame the oracle of delphi it appears was once asked if there were any man wiser than socrates andreplied that there was not socrates professes to have been completely puzzled since he knewnothing and yet a god cannot lie he therefore went about among men reputed wise to seewhether he could convict the god of error first he went to a politician who was thought wiseby many and still wiser by himself he soon found that the man was not wise and explainedthis to him kindly but firmly and the consequence was that he hated me he then went to thepoets and asked them to explain passages in their writings but they were unable to do sothen i knew that not by wisdom do poets write poetry but by a sort of genius and inspirationthen he went to the artisans but found them equally disappointing in the process he says hemade many dangerous enemies finally he concluded that god only is wise and by his answerhe intends to show that the wisdom of men is worth little or nothing he is not speaking of socrates he is only using my name by way of illustration as if he said he o men is thewisest who like socrates knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing this business ofshowing up pretenders to wisdom takes up all his time and has left him in utter poverty but hefeels it a duty to vindicate the oracle young men of the richer classes he says having not much to do enjoy listening to himexposing people and proceed to do likewise thus increasing the number of his enemies forthey do not like to confess that their pretence of knowledge has been detected so much for the first class of accusers socrates now proceeds to examine his prosecutor meletus that good man and true lover of hiscountry as he calls himself he asks  in the clouds socrates is represented as denying the existence of zeus 
indictment the more so as he does not know who are the men from whom it comes except inthe case of aristophanes he points out in reply to these older grounds of hostility that he isnot a man of sciencei have nothing to do with physical speculationsthat he is not a teacherand does not take money for teaching he goes on to make fun of the sophists and to disclaimthe knowledge that they profess to have what then is the reason why i am called wise andhave such an evil fame the oracle of delphi it appears was once asked if there were any man wiser than socrates andreplied that there was not socrates professes to have been completely puzzled since he knewnothing and yet a god cannot lie he therefore went about among men reputed wise to seewhether he could convict the god of error first he went to a politician who was thought wiseby many and still wiser by himself he soon found that the man was not wise and explainedthis to him kindly but firmly and the consequence was that he hated me he then went to thepoets and asked them to explain passages in their writings but they were unable to do sothen i knew that not by wisdom do poets write poetry but by a sort of genius and inspirationthen he went to the artisans but found them equally disappointing in the process he says hemade many dangerous enemies finally he concluded that god only is wise and by his answerhe intends to show that the wisdom of men is worth little or nothing he is not speaking of socrates he is only using my name by way of illustration as if he said he o men is thewisest who like socrates knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing this business ofshowing up pretenders to wisdom takes up all his time and has left him in utter poverty but hefeels it a duty to vindicate the oracle young men of the richer classes he says having not much to do enjoy listening to himexposing people and proceed to do likewise thus increasing the number of his enemies forthey do not like to confess that their pretence of knowledge has been detected so much for the first class of accusers socrates now proceeds to examine his prosecutor meletus that good man and true lover of hiscountry as he calls himself he asks  in the clouds socrates is represented as denying the existence of zeus who are the people who improve the young meletus first mentions the judges then underpressure is driven step by step to say that every athenian except socrates improves the youngwhereupon socrates congratulates the city on its good fortune next he points out that goodmen are better to live among than bad men and therefore he cannot be so foolish as to corrupthis fellowcitizens intentionally but if unintentionally then meletus should instruct him notprosecute him the indictment had said that socrates not only denied the gods of the state but introducedother gods of his own meletus however says that socrates is a complete atheist and adds hesays that the sun is stone and the moon earth socrates replies that meletus seems to think he isprosecuting anaxagoras whose views may be heard in the theatre for one drachma socrates of course points out that this new accusation of completeatheism contradicts the indictment and then passes on to more general considerations the rest of the apology is essentially religious in tone he has been a soldier and has remainedat his post as he was ordered to do now god orders me to fulfil the philosophers mission ofsearching into myself and other men and it would be as shameful to desert his post now as intime of battle fear of death is not wisdom since no one knows whether death may not be thegreater good if he were offered his life on condition of ceasing to speculate as he has donehitherto he would reply men of athens i honour and love you but i shall obey god ratherthan you and while i have life and strength i shall never cease from the practice and teachingof philosophy exhorting any one whom i meet  for know that this is the command of godand i believe that no greater good has ever happened in the state than my service to the godhe goes on i have something more to say at which you may be inclined to cry out but i believe that to hearme will be good for you and therefore i beg that you will not cry out i would have you knowthat if you kill such a one as i am you will injure yourselves more than you will injure me nothing will injure me not meletus nor yet anytusthey cannot for a bad man is not permittedto injure a better than himself i do not deny that  cf acts v

there seems hardly any doubt that the historical socrates claimed to be guided by an oracle ordaimon whether this was analogous to what a christian would call the voice of conscience orwhether it appeared to him as an actual voice it is impossible to know joan of arc was inspiredby voices which are a common form of insanity socrates was liable to cataleptic trances at leastthat seems the natural explanation of such an incident as occurred once when he was on militaryservice one morning he was thinking about something which he could not resolve he would not give itup but continued thinking from early dawn until noonthere he stood fixed in thought and atnoon attention was drawn to him and the rumour ran through the wondering crowd that socrateshad been standing and thinking about something ever since the break of day at last in theevening after supper some ionians out of curiosity brought out their mats and slept in the open air that they might watch himand see whether he would stand all night there he stood until the following morning and withthe return of light he offered up a prayer to the sun and went his way this sort of thing in a lesser degree was a common occurrence with socrates at the beginning ofthe symposium socrates and aristodemus go together to the banquet but socrates drops behindin a fit of abstraction when aristodemus arrives agathon the host says what have you donewith socrates aristodemus is astonished to find socrates not with him a slave is sent to lookfor him and finds him in the portico of a neighbouring house there he is fixed says the slaveon his return and when i call to him he will not stir those who know him well explain that hehas a way of stopping anywhere and losing himself without any reason they leave him aloneand he enters when the feast is half over every one is agreed that socrates was very ugly he had a snub nose and a considerable paunch hewas uglier than all the silenuses in the satyric drama he was alwaysdressed in shabby old clothes and went barefoot everywhere his indifference to heat and coldhunger and thirst amazed every one alcibiades in the symposium describing socrates onmilitary service says his endurance was simply marvellous when being cut off from our supplies we were compelledto go without foodon such occasions which often happen in time of war he was superior notonly to me but to everybody there was no one to be compared to him  his fortitude inenduring cold was also surprising there was a severe frost for the winter in that region is reallytremendous and everybody else either remained indoors or if they went out had on an amazingquantity of clothes and were well shod and had their feet swathed in felt and fleeces in the midstof this socrates with his bare feet on the ice and in his ordinary dress marched better than theother soldiers who had shoes and they looked daggers at him because he seemed to despise them his mastery over all bodily passions is constantly stressed he seldom drank wine but when hedid he could outdrink anybody no one had ever seen him drunk in love even under thestrongest temptations he remained platonic if plato is speaking the truth he was the perfect orphic saint in the dualism of heavenly soul and earthly body he had achieved the completemastery of the soul over the body his indifference to death at the last is the final proof of thismastery at the same time he is not an orthodox orphic it is only the fundamental doctrines thathe accepts not the superstitions and ceremonies of purification the platonic socrates anticipates both the stoics and the cynics the stoics held that the supremegood is virtue and that a man cannot be deprived of virtue by outside causes this doctrine isimplicit in the contention of socrates that his judges cannot harm him the cynics despisedworldly goods and showed their contempt by eschewing the comforts of civilization this is thesame point of view that led socrates to go barefoot and illclad it seems fairly certain that the preoccupations of socrates were ethical rather than scientific in the apology as we saw he says i have nothing to do with physical speculations the earliest of the platonic dialogues which are generally supposed to be the most socratic are mainly occupiedwith the search for definitions of ethical terms the charmides is concerned with the definition oftemperance or moderation the lysis with friendship the laches with courage in all of these noconclusion is arrived at but socrates makes it clear
